   * Race

2. Incarceration Trends

   * Race
   * Drug Offenses

3. Gun Trends

   * Trends in possession
   * Trends in violence
   * Public opinion and gun control

#  Crime Trends

---
# National Trends

Primary sources:

* Uniform Crime Report (UCR)

   + Crimes known to police
   + Departments covering over 90% of population
   + Handled by FBI

???

Crimes known to police are not the majority of crimes

More serious crimes are more reliably reported; homicides, robberies, serious thefts (insurance)

Participation is not mandatory, so some places no covered

UCR reporting sometimes inconsistent--better to compare within locality than between them



--

* National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)

   + Personal victimization
   + Survey of 50-80 thousand per year
   + US Census Bureau

???

NCVS leverages expertise of census bureau with stratified multistage cluster sample.

Interviews entire household every 6 months over three year period.

Problem: Domestic violence

Disadvantage: Sample means smaller area estimates not representative or reliable; insufficient power

---
# Homicide, Robbery, GTA

The most serious crimes peaked in the early 1990s
 * The "Great Crime Decline" refers to steady drop occurring after this peak

![](img/ucr_1980_2010.PNG)

.footnote[Source: Baumer &amp; Wolff (2014)]

???

This is UCR--usually very accurate for these crime types

The crime peak was somewhat highly concentrated in city centers

Heavily weighted toward gun violence related to drug sales and gangs; racially disparate

Homicide rates now look like early 1960s--a bit higher than 1950s which were an all-time low while stats tracked

---
# Burglary, Theft

Other forms of crime had little or no early 1990s spike
* Continuous downward trend since 1980
* Slowed in recent years with some rebounding

![](img/ncvs_1980_2010.PNG)

.footnote[Source: Baumer &amp; Wolff (2014)]

???

UCR does not capture these crime types accurately, so this is NCVS

Thefts higher than 1960s but otherwise similar--we're at nearly an all-time low

---
# The Crime Decline

Crime declined rapidly after early 1990s high

Some theorized reasons:

* Fewer 15-25 year olds
* Economic growth: Lower joblessness, higher wages
* Crack market decline
* Roe v Wade: Fewer crime prone after 1974, fewer 20-25
* Police and incarceration (deterrence / incapacitation)
* Sharkey: Rise of community organizations
* Reduced involvement in risky behaviors
* Gentrification: "Retaking" of city centers

# Decomposing Trends

]

.pull-right[
![](soc371_lecture_04_trends_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

All cities here actually follow the same general trend

???

Decomposition is a fancy word for separating out different sources of variation

In this simple case, every city has a different average level of crime, and every point has random variation

But once you remove the shared change they all experienced, all that remains is that different base and random variation

Be skeptical of politicians taking credit for crime declines when the trends are similar elsewhere--and even if they aren't, they probably didn't do it either.

---

.image-full[
![](img/homicide_history.png)
]

???

Slightly misleading as there was another trough at the start here--but stats not well kept then.

Prohibition kept rates up high until 1930s

War and post-war period were unique with full employment, massive economic expansion

---
# Age-Crime Curve

Involvement in crime follows an age-crime curve
* Violent crime peaks later (~20) than property crime (~16)
* Male crime `\(\geq\)` 5 times female crime
   + Wider for violent, narrower for (some) property

.image-shorter[
![](img/age_crime.svg)
]

???

Crime in general peaks around 16-21.

This is a stable empirical reality pretty much everywhere and throughout time

All theories of crime must address this to be relevant

---
# Homicide by Age

.pull-left[
![](img/hom_off_rates_age.PNG)
]
.pull-right[
![](img/hom_vic_rates_age.PNG)
]

* Strong overlap between offenders and victims.

* Offending more strongly concentrated in youth than victimization

.footnote[Source: Bureau of Justice Statistics]

???

The average age of victims is about 32, of offenders about 28

About 50% of homicide victims know their offender; drastically higher for children


---
# Age Distribution

Because age is related to crime, changes in age distribution impact crime:

* Population Booms
* Large Scale Mortality Events
* Fertility Declines

These can cause massive changes in crime rates many years after they occur.

*A large increase in births will produce a large increase in crime almost 20 years later*

---
# Baby Booms

---
# Change Over Time

There is evidence the curve itself is changing too.

![](img/ojjdp_age_crime.PNG)

.footnote[Source: Official of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention]

???

This is Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention data

Arrests not same as participation; majority of crimes, especially minor, go unnoticed.

May represent changes in policy as well as underlying rates.

---
# Homicide by Sex

.pull-left[
![](img/hom_off_rates_sex.PNG)
]
.pull-right[
![](img/hom_vic_rates_sex.PNG)
]

.footnote[Source: Bureau of Justice Statistics]

???

Vast majority of murders are committed by men

Most victims are also male

Nearly all homicides of women are done by men, however

---
# Homicide by Race

.pull-left[
![](img/hom_off_rates_race.PNG)
]
.pull-right[
![](img/hom_vic_rates_race.PNG)
]

.footnote[Source: Bureau of Justice Statistics]

???

Homicide offending and victimization is highly concentrated in young black male population

This is aprticularly the case in the early 1990s

We'll get more of a handle on this later when we read Divergent Social Worlds

---
# Intra- / Inter-racial Offending

.image-full[
![](img/bjs_nonfatal_victimization_race.PNG)
]

???

The vast majority of violence occurs between people who are acquainted

People typically know others like themselves

Violence is more concentrated in more segregated areas and among more segregated people (i.e. poorer)

# Incarceration Trends

---

.image-full[

]

.footnote[Source: [Smallman12q, Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._incarceration_rates_1925_onwards.png)]

---

.image-tall[
![](img/international-incarceration-rates.png)
]

???

We have the highest officially reported incarceration rate in the world

It is unlikely that all countries accurately report incarceration statistics, so take them with a grain of salt

---

.image-full[
![](img/incarceration_rate_crime_type.png)
]

.footnote[Source: National Academies (2014) *The Growth of Incarceration in the United States: Exploring Causes and Consequences (2014)*]

???

This looks pretty bad, but keep in mind it lumps together all drug crimes while disaggregating violence and not including theft, the most common property crime.

---
# Race / Ethnicity

.image-short[
![](img/incarceration_rate_race.png)
]

.footnote[Source: National Academies (2014) *The Growth of Incarceration in the United States: Exploring Causes and Consequences (2014)*]

???

Increase in incarceration was larger for black and hispanic populations, though whites did see a more than doubling.

That's comparable proportional increase for whites and hispanics, but much higher for black.

---

.image-tall[
![](img/ppi_breakdown.png)
]

???

Despite war on drugs, current prison population is not dominated by drug offenders

Drug offenses often have shorter sentences--more turnover than for violent crimes

Increase in incarcerated population due mainly to general increase in sentences across the board

---
# Drug Arrest Trends by Race

.image-short[
![](img/drug_arrest_rate_race.png)
]

.footnote[Source: National Academies (2014) *The Growth of Incarceration in the United States: Exploring Causes and Consequences (2014)*]

???

Massive increase in arrests mainly seen for black individuals

Some of this due to targeting of inner city drug markets

---
# Drug Use by Race

.image-full[
![](img/drugs_race_hamilton.png)
]

.footnote[Source: [The Hamilton Project](https://www.hamiltonproject.org/charts/rates_of_drug_use_and_sales_by_race_rates_of_drug_related_criminal_justice)]

???

Substance use tends to be somewhat higher for whites than blacks

Highest groups typically AINA; Hispanic lower than black, Asian lowest

Pattern of arrest and incarceration follows concentration of police attention more than patterns in use or sales

---

# Guns

---
# Second amendment

"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."

--

* State vs. Federal Power

???

Framers of constitution were suspicious of federal government; state-regulated militias were thought to protect from federal government

Complex though: Conception is that one cannot ban arms because citizens make up the militia; guns typically owned by individuals

--

* Collective Right vs. Individual Right

???

Conception of individual right to bear arms--as opposed to collective state-level--is basically nonexistent until 1960s and was not legally mainstream until 2000s, even among conservative justices.

--

* *District of Columbia v. Heller* (2008)

???

Case established precedent for individual right to gun ownership independent of militia and including for self-defense.

Issue more or less settled for now barring a constitutional amendment

---



.image-tall[
![](soc371_lecture_04_trends_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

???

US civilians own just shy of 400 million firearms, which is about 46% of all guns in the world

That's about three times the firearms held by all militaries in the world combined (133 million).

Gun ownership in US (vs Europe) is more heavily weighted toward handguns; direct comparisons of gun counts are misleading as handguns are generally the issue.

Gun Ownership Across States

.pull-right[

&lt;br&gt;

.image-full[
![](img/pew_gun_death_rate.png)
]
]

???

Overall gun death rates are correlated with gun ownership

Gun homicide rates exhibit a weaker correlation because of the rural vs. urban issue--will get to that

---

.image-short[
![](img/gun_ownership_1959_2010.png)
]

* Gun *ownership* is declining
   + In 2016, pproximately 22% of adults owned guns
* *Concentration* of gun ownership is increasing
   + 3% of citizens own half of US guns, averaging 17 each

.footnote[Sources: [Patrick Egan, Monkey Cage](https://themonkeycage.org/2012/07/the-declining-culture-of-guns-and-violence-in-the-united-states/), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/15/the-gun-numbers-just-3-of-american-adults-own-a-collective-133m-firearms)]

---

.image-tall[
![](img/pew_gun_ownership.png)
]

???

Gun owners tend to be older white males in rural areas

Urban gun ownership is uncommon

The highest risk group for firearm violence is young black males who have low rates of gun ownership in general

---

.image-short[

![](soc371_lecture_04_trends_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

* Most gun deaths are suicides

* Mass shootings are small component of overall death count

* [Police account for approximately 8% of adult male homicides (Edwards, Esposito, &amp; Lee 2018)](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304559)

???

Can't disaggregate above by police, but vast majority of police homicides are shootings.

---

.image-full[
![](img/hom_weapon_type.png)
]

.footnote[Source: [Bureau of Justice Statistics](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf)]

* Handguns used in vast majority of homicides
   + Most handguns in homicides acquired illegally or through transfers

???

Legality of firearms involved in crime is not well recorded

What work has been done suggests majority are obtained via direct theft, sale of stolen weapons, or unrecorded transfers.


---

# Assault Deaths in US vs. OECD

.image-full[
![](img/healy_assault_deaths.jpg)
]

???

Most assault deaths are firearms in US. Lower firearm death rates elsewhere.

Not a good look

Actual rates of assault are not this out of proportion

Issue here is more effective weapons in course of assaults

---
# Assault Deaths in US vs. OECD

.image-full[
![](img/healy_assault_deaths_mx.png)
]

???

Bringing in some excluded OECD countries makes US look a little better

Until you consider Mexico has a continuous drug war going on. Recent spike back up was beginning of Calderon's militaristic approach to cartels.

Estonia had serious issues with drug crime, organized crime, and alcohol abuse after gaining independence and shifting to market economy. It now has a lower homicide rate than the US.

---

# Assault Deaths by US Region

.image-full[
![](img/heal_assault_deaths_region.jpg)
]

---
# Gun Homicides in US cities 

* Gun homicides are concentrated in cities
    + Great heterogeneity between cities
       * Seattle: 3.7 per 100k
       * St. Louis: 66.1 per 100k
    + Within cities, concentrated in small area

???

Gun homicide rates--not just counts--are much higher in urban areas than rural

Gun homicides are concentrated in small number of cities, small areas within those cities

Differences in violence often don't map to other crimes: St. Louis only about 20% more property crime.

--

* Gun ownership is low in cities
    + Gun ownership high for urban residents involved in crime


???

Gun ownership is a rural thing, but gun homicides are an urban thing

Relationship is complex.

---

.image-tall[
![](img/city_country_firearm_homicides.jpg)
]

???

Note that within the comparison countries, they have individual cities with similar concentrations

---


.image-short[
![](soc371_lecture_04_trends_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

* Weapons in mass shootings are usually obtained legally

* Handguns and long guns used equally
   + Long guns account for 1.4 times as many deaths

---

.image-short[
![](img/gallup_gun_laws.png)
]

* Mass shooting events typically do not increase support for gun laws
   + Response is largely increased polarization
   + Gun sales *rise* after publicized shootings

---
# Specific Gun Policies

.image-full[
![](img/pew_gun_policies.png)
]

---
# Guns as Facilitator



Firearms are most effective weapon available for most violence
   + Those predisposed to violence will seek out guns
   + Handguns are also concealable
   
???

If you're expecting conflict, handguns can be carried all the time

If you want to inflict maximum harm, long guns are universally superior

This is why mass shootings and conventional homicide are totally different things; can't address the same way; same with DV


--

Vast majority of gun owners do not engage in violence
   + Large number of guns means easy to acquire illegally

???

Ownership only really correlated with domestic violence homicides (and suicides)

No one is shipping guns straight to criminals

Original source of guns is always some legitimate sale

Pathway is through theft or transfers

--

This is a public policy conundrum
   + Large, politically active gun owning population
   + Gun laws largely target non-criminal owners
   + Externality problem

???

Gun ownership externality: Ownership enables illegal gun acquisition via theft.

Liberty doctrine of US makes it hard to legally restrict ownership due to this externality.

--

Ex. Policy: Focused Deterrence
   + Target high risk individuals in high risk areas
   + Coordinate police, social services, and community orgs

???

Focused deterrence recognizes concentration issue, goes after highest risk pool aggressively; evidence better than many other approaches

# Discussion

---
# Questions 1

* "I feel that this reading showed how skewed local and national views on crime rates can be opposed to actual statistics based on where an individual lives as well as the story we tell ourselves as Americas, usually through media and anecdotal stories. Based on perception alone, do you view the neighborhood you live in as safe or dangerous? High crime or low crime? Why? What are the indicators that you use to assess this?"

--

* "Baumer and Wolff respectfully argue that NYC's great crime decline was not only local and that many of the reasons it did disproportionally decline may have had something with policing. Considering the current movement, how do you see this playing a role in a counter argument to defunding the police? What do you think Baumer and Wolff's opinions are regarding defunding the police?"

???

Most crim folks believe we're both over and under policing. General belief in necessity of police but role is far, far too broad.

---
# Questions 2

* "Beyond Crime and Punishment: Prisons and Inequalities was published almost 20 years ago and we still see the same trend of black men making the majority of the prison population today. Additionally, we see the same association between criminal behavior and economic disadvantage. Even though this is a systematic problem, what are some things we could do so that we don't see the same trend another 20 years later?"

--

* "The article Evaluating Contemporary Crime Drop(s) in America, New York City, and Many Other Places mentioned that one possible explanation for crime drop is an increase of video gaming. This seems to be contrasting to what I grew up with. How do you think the trend in crimes relates to cultural upbringing?"

???

Psych, Soc, Pub Health, and others have documented increase in anxiety, reduction in independence, increased time indoors, reduced unstructured time of youth, reductions in dating, sex, drug use, increases in suicide. Links to social media, internet, constraining parenting.

---
# Some Clarifications

* How can reported crimes be lower and the amount of people going to prison be tripled? [Are] police arresting people for crimes that are not being reported?

???

Some policing strategies implemented in the 90s and 2000s involved more proactive policing. But what is mostly going on is harsher penalties. We're incarcerating for things we didn't used to, and doing so for longer.

--

* Balancing "target hardening" against crime with avoiding incarcerating more people--opportunity reduction and displacement.

???

We'll get into criminal opportunity later, but a consistent finding is that removing criminal opportunities prevents crimes from being committed without displacing them elsewhere. This would reduce incarceration and crime at the same time.

--

* I wonder if there are any other statistics that are masked by the prison population and possibly used for political agenda?

???

A big one is population counts. People in prison typically cannot vote, but they get counted for allocating representation. Having a large prison in your area can give you a big boost in political power. This results in a shift of political power from urban black areas to rural white areas. There's movements to get that pop reallocated to the pre-incarceration districts of prisoners.

--

* "Why do you think that crimes have gone down but the number of incarcerated prisoners has gone up? With that is there a noticeable trend with race and accused crime, is this based on a systematic flaw in the police force or a trend of systematic racism in the people making the calls?"

???

Most policing is reactive and there's good evidence people are more likely to call the police on black and Hispanic people, particularly in white neighborhoods. C&amp;C paper. Police are also disproportionately deployed to minority areas. You don't need any individual officer bias to generate outcomes.

--

* How is education related to race, crime, and incarceration?

???

Poor, black, urban neighborhoods have bad schools, few conventional opportunities for success. Staying in school makes less sense when it doesn't seem like it gets you anywhere--and maybe you aren't learning anything anyway.

### Things to pay attention to:

Police data should not be taken at face value!
* Official crime rates are combination of actual victimization and willingness to call police.
* Racial bias is hard to measure with police data
