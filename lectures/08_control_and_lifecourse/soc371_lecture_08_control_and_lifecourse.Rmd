# Overview

Social Control Theory

Life Course Criminology

---
class: inverse
# Social Control Theory

---
# Context

* Durkheim as intellectual predecessor

   + Anomie and egoism as weak bonds (Hirschi 1969)
   + Strain (anomie) theories claim this too

--

* Also Hobbes

   + Given our natural tendency to pursue our short term private interests, how is society possible?

--

* Dominance of highly socialized theories of deviance

   + Strain theory
   
      + Delinquents share conventional cultural goals and norms
      + Deviance emerges from inability to attain these goals 

   + Cultural deviance
   
      + Delinquents do not share conventional goals and norms
      + Deviance emerges from different (learned) goals and norms

   + Shared assumptions: Crime does not come naturally and cause of crime is located in social life.

* Neglect of key elements

   + Family
   + Agency
   + Conformity


---
# Interrogating Assumptions

* Strain Theory

   + Most delinquent acts are minor and delinquents mostly conform
   + Social class is unrelated to self-reported delinquency
   + Higher aspirations don't predict delinquency

> Strain theory represents the horrors, the nightmares, of middle class people who imagine what it would be like to be shut out of the process of accumulation. (LAUGHTER) It's a terrible thing, but it has nothing to do with crime. (LAUGHTER)

- Hirschi, in Laub (2002)

--

* Cultural Deviance

   + Ambiguous assumptions
   + No evidence for deviant subcultures teaching pro-criminal norms (Costello & Laub 2020)
   + Criminals largely acknowledge conventional norms

---
# Hirschi's Offender

* Not integrated into family, school, or community

* Little interest in education, work, conventional success

   + But no alternative value or reward system
   
* Unencumbered by restraints on deviant behavior

* No complex motivations
  
   + Deviance is easiest path to many ends

> The more weakened the groups to which the individual belongs, the less he depends on them, the more he consequently depends only on himself and recognizes no other rules of conduct than what are founded on his private interests.

- Durkheim (1897) *Suicide*

---
# Control Theory

* Deviance is restrained by bonds to conventional society

* Elements of bonds

   + Attachment
   + Commitment
   + Involvement
   + Belief

# Causes of Delinquency

Clear conceptualizations

Clear operationalizations

Critical tests against competing theories

Survey measures

Hirschi was here at UW when published; was his dissertation

Life-Course approaches are compatible with other theories of crime
