# Incapacitation vs. Selective Incapacitation

---
# Incapacitation

Segregate criminals via imprisonment to prevent future crime

???

Cannot commit crimes, at least in public, if not in public

--

* Incapacitation vs. deterrence

    + Behavioral vs. non-behavioral
    + Direct vs. indirect

???

Deterrence is behavioral: Use punishment to prevent everyone or the punished from committing future crime

Incapacitation is not behavioral: You're just stuffing people in prison so others are not exposed to them

Incapacitation only directly effects whoever is incapacitated

Deterrence has both direct (specific) and indirect (general) effects

They're tied together though--probably hard to have incapacitation without deterrent effect

--

* Modest effects on crime

   + Incarcerating one person prevents *their* crime
   + May be replacement of offender
   + Negative second-order effects

???

Incapacitation does guarantee those folks cannot commit crimes, but it appears to have weak effects on crime

To some degree there may be replacement: Remove one offender, someone else takes same role

May have consequences: Criminogenic learning in prison, damage to neighborhoods they come from

--

* **Expensive**

   + Greater than $30,000 per year on average in US
   + Loss of productivity

???

Warehousing in prison is extremely costly

Combined with the modest effect, it is incredibly inefficient

You get an added loss from that person no longer working and paying taxes

Compare to work or education that can have direct cost but then increase tax revenue

--

*Incapacitation is a poor tool for general crime control*

---
# Selective Incapacitation

Selectively imprisoning high rate offenders

???

While general incapacitation is not efficient, it might be a way to handle chronic offenders unresponsive to other strategies

--

* How effective would this be?

???

First question is how effective would it actually be to target chronic offenders

--

* Problem is prediction

???

Second question is how do we determine who will be chronic offender

Need to be able to predict who will commit crimes in the future

Crimes in past, no matter how numerous, don't necessarily guarantee many in the future

# Criminal Careers Research

---
# Delinquency in a Birth Cohort

Tracking criminal behavior over life course

???

We'll get back to life course studies later! For now, focusing on criminal careers and relevance to incapacitation.

--

* Philadelphia 1945 cohort (Wolfgang, Figlio, &amp; Sellin)
   * 9,945 boys
   * 35% with police record by 18
   * Chronic offenders: 6% of cohort commit 50% of crimes

???

Wolfgang, Filgio, &amp; Sellin conducted first cohort life course analysis of deviance

All boys born in Philadelphia in 1945 (tracked via school and police records), tracking all recorded deviance from at least age 10 to 18.

Rather than just knowing how many crimes committed or how many offenders there are, this allows tracking trajectories of criminality in full population

This deals with issues like inadvertently comparing people raised under different conditions

--

* Philadelphia 1958 cohort
  * 28,000
  * 7.5% of cohort: &gt; 5 arrests, 61% of crimes
  
* Racine, WI (Shannon)
  * 25% account for 80% of arrests
 
???

Similar results in cohorts separated by 13 years

--

Selective Incapacitation: Lock up this ~6%, cut crime in half

???

General idea is if most crime is concentrated in small group, why not lock up that group?

---
# Blumstein &amp; Cohen

* Decompose crime rate into participation rate and frequency rate
   * Participation rate: Proportion of pop arrested
   * Frequency rate: Average arrests per arrested
   
`\(\text{Crime Rate} = \text{Participation Rate} * \text{Frequency Rate}\)`

`\(\frac{\text{# of Arrests}}{100,000} = \frac{\text{Arrested People}}{100,000} * \frac{\text{# of Arrests}}{Arrested People}\)`

???

Blumstein and Cohen take a demographic decomposition approach to this problem

Overall crime rate is function of how many are involved in crime at a given time and how many crimes they each commit

--

* Implications
   + If participation high, frequency low, selective incapacitation won't work well
   + If participation is low, frequency high, selective incapacitation has great potential

???

Separating participation and frequency is informative--it implies policy responses

If most crime is concentrated in small number of chronic offenders, you can in principle isolate them

If crime more uniformly spread out, each person in prison gains you little

---
# Empirical  Composition

* Participation Rates
   + 50-60% of urban males arrested in lifetime
   + 25% for index crimes (14% white, 50% black)
   + Recidivism: 85-95%

???

Participation is surprisingly high, and most who participate have repeat crimes

Large race difference in participation

--

* Frequency Rates (Arrests in DC &amp; Detroit)
   + Aggravated Assault: 2-3 per year
   + Robbery: 3-5 per year
   + Property Offenses: &gt;5 per year
   + Auto Theft: 3 in DC; 9 in Detroit
   + No difference between white and black offenders

???

On average those arrested for a given crime are arrested multiple times in a year

But frequency of crime looks basically identical across race


---
# Self-Report Frequency

Greenwood &amp; Abrahamse (1982) *Selective Incapacitation*. Rand Corporation.

* Survey of 2100 male prison and jail inmates
* Inmate reports before incarceration
   + Robbery
      * 50% of robbers &lt;4 per year
      * 10% of robber &gt;70 per year
   + Burglary
      * 50% of burglars &lt;5 per year
      * 10% of burglars &gt;195 per year
???

Rand study to evaluate benefits of selective incapacitation; interviewed inmates about crime frequency prior to prison

We'll visit their conclusions later

Found high concentration of offenses in small population

--

Career lengths are short

   + Average less than 6 years for serious offenses

???

Most do not stay involved in serious crime for long

---
# Key Points


* Crime frequency highly skewed

   + May be a subpopulation for incapacitation

--

* Race differences are in participation not frequency

   + No justification for differential treatment
   
???

Blumstein &amp; Cohen: Both "ethically wrong" and "empirically incorrect" to treat offenders differently by race; race differences in initiation but not frequency

The criminal legal system gets involved only once people commit crimes

If there's no racial difference after participation takes place, there's no justification for differential treatment

Empirically could be justification for differential treatment in preventing participation--but that's not legal system, that's social policy (which they say is justified empirically and normatively)

--

* Incapacitation will not work in criminal markets

???

In markets like drug selling, role will just be filled with a new person

---
# Age-Crime Curve

![](../04_trends/img/age_crime.svg)
]

---
# Moffit and Age-Crime Curve

.image-full[
![](img/moffitt.svg)
]

???

Terrie Moffit and colleagues suggest the age crime curve can be decomposed into two contributors

Life-Course Persistent Offenders start early and continue longer

Adolescence-Limited Offenders age into crime, approach persistent offenders, then age out rapidly

---
# Life-Course Persistent Offenders

* Serious underlying problems
   + Cognitive deficits
   + Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
   + Psychopathy

???

This is a psychological and social-psychological theory of crime

It is also a typological theory: There's a qualitative difference between these types of offenders

--

* Early maturation, large physical size

???

Group may mature earlier either mentally or physically, more likely to be larger in stature (it gives advantage in deviance)

--

* Cumulative disadvantage

???

Cognitive and emotional issues often result of accumulated disadvantage: abuse, neglect, difficult environment.

--

* Temper tantrums in late adulthood

   + Poor and unstable jobs
   + Poor and unstable marriages

???

Angry outbursts and problem behavior compromise all aspects of their life

---
# Adolescence-Limited OFfenders

* "Normal" adolescents

* Learn deviance from peers (partying, fighting, vandalism, theft)

* Learn from life-course persistents

* Age out due to life course transitions

---
# Gottfredson &amp; Hirschi

* Ignore this research

   + Reflects unmeaningful statistical variation
   + Cannot identify career criminal before fact
   + Identify career criminal by 5+ offenses, but by then cease to be career criminal due to age

???

Gott &amp; Hirschi are curmudgeons of crim--all that matters is self-control

--

* Analogy: For heart attacks, prevention is better

* Question: Can we predict the chronic offender?

---
# Predicting the High Rate Offender

Greenwood &amp; Abrahamse (1982)

* Use self-reports of crime and background data to predict high-risk offenders

* 7-point prediction scale
   + Incarceration &gt;2 year period
   + Prior conviction for robbery and burglary
   + Juvenile conviction before age 16
   + Commitment to juvenile institution
   + Heroin or barbiturate use as a juvenile
   + Heroin or barbiturate use within 2 years of arrest
   + Employed less than half time within 2 years of arrest

---
# Sentencing Rule and Simulations (Greenwood)



* Sentencing rule: High rate offender gets 8 years in prison, all others 1 year

   + Result: Reduce robbery by 15%, imprisoned robbers by 5%
   + False positive rate of 60%, problem of false negatives

--

* RAND study
   
   + After 24 months, prediction scale does 5-10% better than chance; not significant
   + May effectively identify low-risk offenders (Auerhahn 1999)
   
---
# Potential Problems

* Changes sentencing from doing justice to crime control

* Used unemployment as predictor--victim blaming

* Assumes individual will behave like average member of classification group (high rate offender)

* Ignores agency and reform
