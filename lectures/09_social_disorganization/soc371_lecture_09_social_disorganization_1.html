# Overview

* Context

   + Turn of century urban life
   + The Chicago School
   + Concentric Zone Theory

* Juvenile Delinquency in Urban Areas

   + Empirical Observations
   + Social Disorganization
   + Cultural Transmission
   + Policy Implications

---
# Context

* Turn of century

???

Lot of transitions occurring in United States around this period

rural to urban transitions; Rise in concern over urban ills

Growth of positivism and extrapolations of Darwinian science into social realms

--

* Dominance of individualistic theories

   + Evolutionary and biological
   + Mental deficiency

???

Dominant theories in crim individualistic and many emphasize evolutionary and biological components

Innate criminality of genetics; biological determinism; rise of eugenics and race science in this period

Lombroso, for instance, was rejecting Beccaria to claim crime as innate rather than rational; the criminal had no choice--compelled by their biological predisposition

--

* Neglect of changing conditions of life

   + Urbanization
   + Mass migration and immigration
   + Inner city poverty and despair (e.g. Sinclair's *The Jungle*)

???

Massive migration into and within US--all into urban centers; different waves from Germany, Ireland, Eastern Europe

Terrible conditions in inner city slums; incredibly abusive conditions of unfettered capitalism; lot of these gave rise to socialist and communist movements

---
# Chicago School

* Dominant program of Sociology

???

19-teens through the 30's. Department was small, never more than 6, but single most influential department / period in Sociology. Through 1950, half the ASA presidents came from Chicago.

Faculty and students included Frederick Thrasher (The Gang), Louis Wirth (The Ghetto), Shaw (The Jackroller), Edwin Sutherland, George Herbert Mead, Herbert Blumer

Chicago school as a term usually refers specifically to the urban sociology 

--

* Theory

   + Symbolic Interaction
   + Subcultures
   + Urban Sociology in General

???

School produced foundation of modern urban sociology and urban studies. Symbolic interaction remains vital to sociology--about construction of meaning, role of meaning as motivation for behavior.

Focus on behavior and characteristics of people as product of their environment and interaction with it

--

* Methodology

   + Ethnography
   + Ecological Analysis
   + The City as Laboratory

???

Chicago school was highly empirical and positivist. Ethnographic work highly systematic--observe behavior and conditions of people, create abstract rules from this.

Also featured quantitative ecological analyses--social versions of biological approaches, with demography as well.

Idea was that cities--in particular Chicago--could be used as a laboratory to investigate civilization as a whole.

---
# Human Ecology School

* Logic of natural ecology 

   + Competition among groups
   + Niches in natural places
   + Social structure and environment, not genetics and traits

???

Chicago school looked to the logic of natural ecology and evolution, but viewed humans not tied to genetic or trait destiny; rather the structures of their natural built world are what is important.

--

* Urban processes

   + Invasion
   + Competition
   + Succession

???

Like in natural ecology, dynamic processes at work producing distribution of people

NAtural metaphor: New pops immigrate (either locally or from afar), do their best to succeed under constraints, eventually improve condition and move out, giving way to new groups

--


* Ernest Burgess's City

   + Continual outward growth
   + Concentric Zones
   + Zone(s) in transition

???

Succession model results in a particular form of growth in urban environments

Cities expand outward, resulting in qualitatively different zones radiating out from center of city

Industry and commerce sit in center

Residences for middle class sit outside

In between is a zone in transition where middle-class have left and industry is encroaching; housing is dilapidated but cheap as owners have ceased investing while waiting for it to be sold

New immigrants come here to work and live, but eventually plan to move outward when they can; this zone is constantly in transition, with high population turnover, poverty, and heterogeneity.

---
# Burgess's Concentric Zones

.image-full[
![](img/burgess_concentric_zone.jpg)
]

???

City core

Zone in transition

Working homes, residential, commuters

Note actual Chicago features

---
# Shaw &amp; McKay

*Juvenile Delinquency in Urban Areas* (1942)

* Data

    * Juvenile court, truancy, and crime records
    * Life histories of delinquents

???

Incredible wealth of quantitative and qualitative data

In particular they deep deep interviews with active delinquents to see how they perceived their trajectories in life

Complexity in their theory is largely because they had such rich, nuanced data

--

* Mapped spatial distribution of delinquency in Chicago

???

Incredibly involved process in the 1930s

Painstakingly mapping every court and truancy record to census tracts and neighborhoods, tallying and comparing, conducting statistical analyses by hand

--

* Theory of social disorganization and cultural transmission

* In part foundation for:
   
   * Differential association (via Sutherland)
   * Control theories (via Reckless, Reiss)

???

Book put forth social disorganization theory with a cultural transmission component.

This was very influential but became unpopular for mix of valid and questionable reasons in 1960s and into early 1980s

---
### Spatial Distribution of Delinquency

.image-full[
![](img/rates_of_delinquents.png)
]
]
.pull-right[
.image-full[
![](img/sm_concentric_zones.png)
]
]

???

Spatial analyses remarkably sophisticated and tremendously laborious.

Thousands upon thousands of individual delinquent records hand mapped to locations.

Compiled massive demographic, social, and economic data; derived theory from this in combination with past theory, interview, and ethnographic evidence

True mixed methods!


---
### Delinquency in Seattle (Shaw &amp; McKay)

.image-full[
![](img/sm_seattle.png)
]

???

In the second edition, 1969, they had reproduced their results using other cities including Seattle, which showed similar results.

---
# Key Findings

* High crime in zone in transition

   + Population turnover and heterogeneity
   + Economic disadvantage
   + Competing delinquent tradition

???

Burgess's zone in transition had highest delinquency rate--but also wide array of other ills, in particular absence of opportunity

While most folks are conforming and conventional, evidence of competing delinquent and criminal values and groups.

--

* Low crime in peripheral neighborhoods

   + Stable, more homogenous population
   + Middle and upper class
   + Absence of delinquent tradition

???

Outer areas more stable, affluent, with more opportunity.

Virtually everyone conforming and conventional--delinquency uncommon and spread out. No substantial competing value system.

--

* Remained high despite ethnic turnover

???

Key insight: Chicago's zone in transition had seen many different waves of ethnic groups. Irish, Italian, German, blacks from South. Delinquency rate stayed the same regardless of who was there.

--

* Ethnic groups moving outward experienced low rates

???

When groups moved out of zone in transition and into periphery, crime rate went down the same regardless of ethnicity.

Considered this strong evidence it had nothing to do with the people and everything to do with the place.

---
## Social Disorganization Theory

#### Shaw &amp; McKay (1942)

&lt;br&gt;

.image-100[
![](img/shaw_mckay.svg)
]

???

They developed a theory that would accomodate the four key empirical findings.

---
# Social Disorganization

*Inability of a community to solve its problems collectively or achieve collective values*

???

Later this would come to be known as informal social control: the ability of a group to regulate itself according consensual norms

--

* Weak and unlinked institutions with no sense of community

   + Family structure
   + Schools
   + Community groups

???

Poverty, heterogeneity, and turnover reduce direct controls of family, weaken controls of school, deprive community of effective local groups, and cause all of those to fail to coordinate.

Essentially, there is little sense of community and instead isolated undersupported pockets trying to independently regulate behavior

--

* Measures used by Shaw &amp; McKay

   * Population loss
   * Proportion rentals vs. owned homes
   * Income
   * Physical deterioration
   * Percentage nonwhite

???

Used many ecological measures, but no clear separation between cause and consequence and no direct measures of the social structures--disorganization itself

The data just weren't there--but remember, they derived much of this from qualitative research; not absence of evidence

--

* Tautology problem: Causes and consequences social disorganization inseparable

???

While they envisioned social disorganization as a institutional problem, they evaluated it using characteristic symptoms

So physical deterioration, say, is evidence of disorganization--but it is also a symptom of disorganization

This apparent tautology was problematic for many researchers--but it was resolved by later conceptions directly measuring disorganization, and also Kornhauser's reformation we'll talk about next time

---
# Causes

* Poor economic conditions (poverty)

   + Reduced conventional opportunities
   + Lack of resources to address problems
   + Reliance on illegal or quasi-legal income

???

Most critical cause is economic: Youth see few opportunities for work or training, more opportunities in crime

No money to invest in upkeep, security, training, and work long hours in hard jobs. Hard to monitor children.

Lack of money may make families reliant on illicit income

--


* Residential Instability

   + Constant disruption 
   + Impermanence 

???

Hard to build relations with others or institutions when everything is constantly changing


Future orientation toward other communities--focus on enduring conditions here to move somewhere better, not fix up where they are.

--


* Ethnic/Racial Heterogeneity

   + Different norms and values (or at least perception of such)
   + Communication barriers
   + Shift to urban living

???

These hamper coordination between families and with other institutions

Ethnic heterogeneity in this time period is also a proxy for transitions to urban living; the ethnic groups here are European immigrants and black Americans from rural south

Urban living has very different issues for managing child social control

---
## Social Disorganization Theory

#### Shaw &amp; McKay (1942)

&lt;br&gt;

.image-100[
![](img/shaw_mckay.svg)
]

???

Just showing it again

---
# Shaw &amp; McKay (1942) on Race

*Racial differences in delinquency are attributable primarily to location of residence.*

&gt; ... it cannot be said that [black delinquency rates] are higher than rates for white boys in comparable areas, since it is impossible to reproduce in white communities the circumstances under which Negro children live... it would not be possible to reproduce the effects of segregation and the barriers to upward mobility. (xxix)

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; Clearly, one must beware of attaching social and economic significance to race or nativity. For, in the present social and economic system, it is the Negroes and the foreign born, or at least the newest immigrants, who have least access to the necessities of life and who are therefore least prepared for the competitive struggle. It is they who are forced to live in the worst slum areas and who are least able to organize against the effects of such living. (155)

???

Remarkably progressive and thoughtful consideration of race throughout the work.

Remember the first quote when you get to reading Divergent Social Worlds. It is still true today.

---
# Loss of Control Over Youth

* Social disorganization produces loss of informal social control

    + Parental supervision
    + Community controls

???

Parents not able to effectively supervise, community not regulating behavior

--

* Spontaneous, unsupervised play groups of children

    + Becomes vehicle for delinquency

???

Unmonitored children can join and form gangs, participate in delinquency; long had robust evidence for this.

---
# Cultural Transmission

* Delinquent tradition transmitted across generations of youth groups

   * Older gangs transmit delinquency to younger play groups
   * Delinquent tradition
      + Values
      + Pressures
      + Rewards and sanctions
   * Transmission is learning of a culture

???

The mechanism Shaw &amp; McKay proposed for stable delinquency across ethnic turnover was passing down of tradition from older, more experienced criminals and delinquents to the young

Older delinquents evidenced success in material and status; prevalent in community

Youth sensitive to positives, insensitive to possible risks; learn values by watching, interacting, and learning

Receive rewards, learn skills by assisting

--

* Delinquent traditions produce persistently high delinquency rates in a community or neighborhood

???

The presence of this tradition could keep delinquency high by transmitting it intergenerationally

When youth move to other places, absence of tradition and established criminals removes support structure (groups, values, rewards) necessary to keep it alive

--

* Empirical evidence

   + Age-spanning in official records
   + Role of older delinquents in life histories
   + Emulation and support of groups
   + Competition with conventional values

???

Some more modern work will claim Shaw &amp; McKay assumed this based only on ecological data--this is false and they probably just never read it.

Ample evidence! Quantitatively connect young and old delinquents in primitive network study

In life histories, repeated description of looking up to older offenders, learning techniques and values from them, receiving support

AT least 80% of official records indicate delinquency done in group--even more if you include pressure from others; group, not individual phenomenon!

Also evidence of value competition where delinquent groups compete with family over the youth: i.e. pressuring youth to steal from family

---
## Policy Implications: Chicago Area Project

* Help inner city residents prevent delinquency

???

Founded by Clifford Shaw in 1930s--talk about public Sociology

Idea here was not an outside intervention but rather try to build community capacity to solve issues

--

* Develop sense of community

    * Increase community participation
    * Strengthen and connect institutions 
    * Increase controls over children
    * Involve natural leaders--also gangs and delinquents

???

Idea is to get directly involved in community, elevating leaders, building institutions, and networking them; get people involved, talking, and supported.

Realizing power of gangs in communities, involved them in process; included ex-convicts in prevention programs; reached out to parolees

--

* Interventions

   * Youth recreation
   * Physical disorder remediation
   * Guidance sessions, parole supervision, and school interventions
   
???

Had multipronged interventions. Built youth recreation to give alternative things for them to do

Cleaned up neighborhood physically

Had informal guidance sessions for delinquent youth--including with ex-convicts, involved community in youth parole supervision, community interventions for kids having trouble in school

--

* Evaluation: Not definitive--but prescient

???

Effects on crime remain somewhat uncertain, but it certainly had positive effect on community organization; programs are still running today

Many efforts look a lot like successful modern approaches. Incredibly prescient approach.

# Discussion

# Some Questions 

* Both readings indicate social disorganization is a problem causing crime (and other problems) in neighborhoods / communities, and it is caused by lots of things. How do we organize communities then?

--

* "Do you think... community studies [cause] stigmatization toward community groups?"

--

* "Sampson and Groves continually bring up the idea that... street-corner teenage peer groups increase the level of delinquency and crime in a community. As a society we have becoming more and more distant, from social media to the increasing size of the population, so how does this play a role into the prevalence of street-corner groups and their additional crime? "

--

* "Shaw and McKay assume that the wealthier communities have more similar values/morals/attitudes, thus leading to decreased rates of crime. Do you think this is a valid assumption?"

???

Shaw &amp; McKay, to be fair, emphasize the public presentation of these values and attitudes. It is heavily about exposure of youth to these things.

---
# Some Clarifications

* "Given our past knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of qualitative and quantitative research, where and how is this decision made by critics and other researchers as to where they draw such line of what research style validates longevity of findings or not, or qualifies a work as substantial, or not?" [Also with respect to use of police data]

???

There isn't a hard rule here at all. It is difficult to predict what becomes a classic. Convincing arguments play an important role. Sometimes data that aren't real strong can be used in a novel way to make a large contribution. Lot of great work has used flawed police data for instance. Many high impact studies have been done with qualitative work in limited environments. On quantitative side, burden is usually on authors to show that their findings are insensitive to forseeable issues with their data or models; e.g. even if there was gross differences in reporting, the findings would hold.

--

* "... delinquency is a group phenomenon. Crime doesn't happen unless there's an opportunity. Would places that allow teenagers to meet up count as a place of opportunity? [Wouldn't schools promote delinquency? As places to plan crimes?]"

???

Yes! Locations that facilitate unstructured peer groups--particularly ones that shield them from view--are opportunity spots. Schools provide some monitoring but also get peers linked together into deviant groups. Lot of violence and property crime happens at and near schools. Underfunded schools have fewer monitors as well.

--

* "[Does Shaw &amp; McKay's work suggest] that disadvantaged neighborhoods will always have high crime/delinquency rate? If so, how can we fix it?"

???

Well, yes. Key here is that delinquency is part of a cluster of spatially-concentrated ills. To get rid of crime, you have to address the underlying structural issues that cause all the symptoms.

--

* "How applicable is the social disorganization model to eastern societies?  Are there differences in education systems that contribute to different crime rates?"

???

Some eastern countries do not have the level of poverty or proximal deprivation you see in US. In others, there's substantial concentrated disadvantage in urban areas. Work in social disorg vein has examined, to my knowledge, Japan, Vietnam, and China with general support, but much more limited than US and European work.

---
# More Clarifications

* Does gentrification affect the crime rate? it creates high residential mobility, a lot of racial/ethnic heterogeneity, and mixed socioeconomic status that seems to increase crime rate, but gentrification also brings in money to the neighborhood.

???

Yes! Gentrification has an interesting relationship to crime. Some findings indicate gentrifiers enter neighborhoods and are more likely to report crime, raising crime rates, but over time they decline due to reinvestment and other changes. I have a C&amp;C paper on the policing side of this. Good review out there by MacDonald and Stokes.

--

* "... I am curious to know how micro-level aspects such as family dynamics could impact crime rates in communities?"

???

Systemic model of social control, which is based on social disorganization, includes family level as key element of social control. Family social control is facilitated by community social control. Intergenerational closure for instance.

--

* "What do Sampson &amp; Groves mean [by], 'system of friendship'? Are work/school acquaintances/'friends' and non-familial mentor figures included?" and "Why do [friend networks] develop less frequently in areas with more delinquency, and is this a circular process of crime creates less local friendship networks which creates more crime?"

???

Focus is on non-family friends living in neighborhood--idea is that the more people you know in neighborhood, more ties, more effective interpersonal control.

Evidence actually indicates there are a lot of strong friend networks in disorganized communities--and they sometimes facilitate crime rather than protect. Later colelctive efficacy work will move beyond this.

--

* "What sort of implications might [social disorganization] have for individuals in the global context that involved become engaged in organized crime? For instance cosa nostra in Italy or similarly Eastern European syndicates, or various cartels that share family and community structures within the organization themselves?"

???

Differential social organization may speak more strongly to this than original social disorganization. Some of these may represent a extreme levels of disorganization giving way to alternate control systems--or systems organized around different goals and values.

---
# One More

* "Juvenile Delinquency in Urban Areas mentioned that rich neighborhoods have the lowest rate of delinquents. However, could it be that they don't actually have the lowest rate but that they have the lowest rate caught by the police?"

???

Absolutely! Shaw &amp; McKay worked with the absolute best data available to them, which was largely court data. They did also use ethnographic evidence but that can't speak to distributions. Later social disorganization work heavily uses self-report and victimization data to overcome this.

---
# For Next Time

* Peterson, Ruth D., and Lauren J. Krivo. 2010. *Divergent Social Worlds.* Pp. 1-70

Things to pay attention to:

* Relationship between social disorganization and racial stratification

* Incomparability of neighborhoods across ethno-racial categories

* Depth and interrelated nature of structural causes

???

Key argument here is that system of ethno-racial stratification produced and is reproducing structural disadvantage

Black and white neighborhoods are literally incomparable: Worst off white folks live in better places than average black person

Issues are deep, structural, interrelated--they defy straightforward solutions
