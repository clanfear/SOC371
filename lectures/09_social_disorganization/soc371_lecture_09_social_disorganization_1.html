# Overview

---
# Context

* Turn of century

--

* Dominance of individualistic theories

   + Evolutionary and biological
   + Mental deficiency

--

* Neglect of changing conditions of life

   + Urbanization
   + Mass migration and immigration
   + Inner city poverty and despair (e.g. Sinclair's *The Jungle*)

---
# Human Ecology School

* Logic of natural ecology 

   + Competition among groups
   + Niches in natural places
   + Social structure and environment, not genetics and traits

???

Chicago school looked to the logic of natural ecology and evolution, but viewed humans not tied to genetic or trait destiny; rather the structures of their natural built world are what is important.

--

* Urban processes

   + Invasion
   + Competition
   + Succession

???

Like in natural ecology, dynamic processes at work producing distribution of people

NAtural metaphor: New pops immigrate (either locally or from afar), do their best to succeed under constraints, eventually improve condition and move out, giving way to new groups

--


* Ernest Burgess's City

   + Continual outward growth
   + Concentric Zones
   + Zone(s) in transition

???

Succession model results in a particular form of growth in urban environments

Cities expand outward, resulting in qualitatively different zones radiating out from center of city

Industry and commerce sit in center

Residences for middle class sit outside

In between is a zone in transition where middle-class have left and industry is encroaching; housing is dilapidated but cheap as owners have ceased investing while waiting for it to be sold

New immigrants come here to work and live, but eventually plan to move outward when they can; this zone is constantly in transition, with high population turnover, poverty, and heterogeneity.

# Shaw &amp; McKay

*Juvenile Delinquency in Urban Areas* (1942)

* Data

    * Juvenile court, truancy, and crime records
    * Life histories of delinquents

???

Incredible wealth of quantitative and qualitative data

In particular they deep deep interviews with active delinquents to see how they perceived their trajectories in life

Complexity in their theory is largely because they had such rich, nuanced data

--

* Mapped spatial distribution of delinquency in Chicago

???

Incredibly involved process in the 1930s

Painstakingly mapping every court and truancy record to census tracts and neighborhoods, tallying and comparing, conducting statistical analyses by hand

--

* Theory of social disorganization and cultural transmission

* In part foundation for:
   
   * Differential association (via Sutherland)
   * Control theories (via Reckless, Reiss)

???

Book put forth social disorganization theory with a cultural transmission component.

This was very influential but became unpopular for mix of valid and questionable reasons in 1960s and into early 1980s

# Key Findings

* High crime in zone in transition

   + Population turnover and heterogeneity
   + Economic disadvantage
   + Competing delinquent tradition

???

Burgess's zone in transition had highest delinquency rate--but also wide array of other ills, in particular absence of opportunity

While most folks are conforming and conventional, evidence of competing delinquent and criminal values and groups.

--

* Low crime in peripheral neighborhoods

   + Stable, more homogenous population
   + Middle and upper class
   + Absence of delinquent tradition

???

Outer areas more stable, affluent, with more opportunity.

Virtually everyone conforming and conventional--delinquency uncommon and spread out. No substantial competing value system.

--

* Remained high despite ethnic turnover

???

Key insight: Chicago's zone in transition had seen many different waves of ethnic groups. Irish, Italian, German, blacks from South. Delinquency rate stayed the same regardless of who was there.

--

* Ethnic groups moving outward experienced low rates

???

When groups moved out of zone in transition and into periphery, crime rate went down the same regardless of ethnicity.

Considered this strong evidence it had nothing to do with the people and everything to do with the place.

## Social Disorganization Theory

#### Shaw &amp; McKay (1942)

&lt;br&gt;

---
# Social Disorganization

*Inability of a community to solve its problems collectively or achieve collective values*

???

Later this would come to be known as informal social control: the ability of a group to regulate itself according consensual norms

--

* Weak and unlinked institutions with no sense of community

   + Family structure
   + Schools
   + Community groups

???

Poverty, heterogeneity, and turnover reduce direct controls of family, weaken controls of school, deprive community of effective local groups, and cause all of those to fail to coordinate.

Essentially, there is little sense of community and instead isolated undersupported pockets trying to independently regulate behavior

--

* Measures used by Shaw &amp; McKay

   * Population loss
   * Proportion rentals vs. owned homes
   * Income
   * Physical deterioration
   * Percentage nonwhite

???

Used many ecological measures, but no clear separation between cause and consequence and no direct measures of the social structures--disorganization itself

The data just weren't there--but remember, they derived much of this from qualitative research; not absence of evidence

--

* Tautology problem: Causes and consequences social disorganization inseparable

???

While they envisioned social disorganization as a institutional problem, they evaluated it using characteristic symptoms

So physical deterioration, say, is evidence of disorganization--but it is also a symptom of disorganization

This apparent tautology was problematic for many researchers--but it was resolved by later conceptions directly measuring disorganization, and also Kornhauser's reformation we'll talk about next time


---
# Loss of Control Over Youth

* Social disorganization produces loss of informal social control

    + Parental supervision
    + Community controls

???

Parents not able to effectively supervise, community not regulating behavior

--

* Spontaneous, unsupervised play groups of children

    + Becomes vehicle for delinquency

???

Unmonitored children can join and form gangs, participate in delinquency; long had robust evidence for this.

---
# Cultural Transmission

* Delinquent tradition transmitted across generations of youth groups

   * Older gangs transmit delinquency to younger play groups
   * Delinquent tradition
      + Values
      + Pressures
      + Rewards and sanctions
   * Transmission is learning of a culture

???

The mechanism Shaw &amp; McKay proposed for stable delinquency across ethnic turnover was passing down of tradition from older, more experienced criminals and delinquents to the young

Older delinquents evidenced success in material and status; prevalent in community

Youth sensitive to positives, insensitive to possible risks; learn values by watching, interacting, and learning

Receive rewards, learn skills by assisting

--

* Delinquent traditions produce persistently high delinquency rates in a community or neighborhood

???

The presence of this tradition could keep delinquency high by transmitting it intergenerationally

When youth move to other places, absence of tradition and established criminals removes support structure (groups, values, rewards) necessary to keep it alive

--

* Empirical evidence

   + Age-spanning in official records
   + Role of older delinquents in life histories
   + Emulation and support of groups
   + Competition with conventional values

???

Some more modern work will claim Shaw &amp; McKay assumed this based only on ecological data--this is false and they probably just never read it.

Ample evidence! Quantitatively connect young and old delinquents in primitive network study

In life histories, repeated description of looking up to older offenders, learning techniques and values from them, receiving support

AT least 80% of official records indicate delinquency done in group--even more if you include pressure from others; group, not individual phenomenon!

Also evidence of value competition where delinquent groups compete with family over the youth: i.e. pressuring youth to steal from family

---
## Policy Implications: Chicago Area Project

* Help inner city residents prevent delinquency

???

Founded by Clifford Shaw in 1930s--talk about public Sociology

Idea here was not an outside intervention but rather try to build community capacity to solve issues

--

* Develop sense of community

    * Increase community participation
    * Strengthen and connect institutions 
    * Increase controls over children
    * Involve natural leaders--also gangs and delinquents

???

Idea is to get directly involved in community, elevating leaders, building institutions, and networking them; get people involved, talking, and supported.

Realizing power of gangs in communities, involved them in process; included ex-convicts in prevention programs; reached out to parolees

--

* Interventions

   * Youth recreation
   * Physical disorder remediation
   * Guidance sessions, parole supervision, and school interventions
   
???

Had multipronged interventions. Built youth recreation to give alternative things for them to do

Cleaned up neighborhood physically

Had informal guidance sessions for delinquent youth--including with ex-convicts, involved community in youth parole supervision, community interventions for kids having trouble in school

--

* Evaluation: Not definitive--but prescient

???

Effects on crime remain somewhat uncertain, but it certainly had positive effect on community organization; programs are still running today

Many efforts look a lot like successful modern approaches. Incredibly prescient approach.
