# Overview

* Broken Windows

   * Zero-Tolerance Policing

* Broken Windows versus Collective Efficacy

* Field Experiments

---
# Broken Windows (Wilson &amp; Kelling)


* Physical and social disorder (incivilities)

   * Physical: Graffiti, dilapidated buildings
   * Social: Public intoxication, panhandling

--

* Disorder signals to criminals indifference to crime

   * Low probability of being seen, reported, arrested

--

* Disorder also undermines community controls

   * Signals neighborhood is out of control, creates fear
   * Mechanisms: Withdrawal from public life; residential mobility

--

* Key Idea: Disorder is not individually harmful but it accumulates

   * Intervene when problem is still small
   * Intervene where problem overwhelms community control capacity

# Order Maintenance Policing

* Residents worry more about low-level disorder than major crimes

   * Consensus on disorder
   * Goal: Stabilie informal control by reducing fear of crime (indirect path)

* Targeting disorder with policing (deterrence)

   * High certainty
   * Minor penalties
   * Ex: Fare evasion, public drinking
   * Mechanism: Deter offenders (direct path)

* New York: Bill Bratton, under Giuliani

   * Stop-and-frisk

---
## Evidence for Policing Disorder

* [Crime (Braga et al. 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0022427815576576)

   * Modest reductions on crime
   * Aggressive order maintenance works poorly
   * Targeting specific places more effective
   
--

* [Fear of Crime (Weisburd et al. 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0022427815577837)

   * No evidence for reduction of fear of crime
   * No evidence for improved informal social control

--

* Unintended consequences

   * Alienating communities from police
   * Increased racial disparities
   * Criminalization of homelessness and mental illness

# Broken Windows versus Collective Efficacy

---
# Broken Windows


[Wilson &amp; Kelling (1982)](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/) describe a system where community disorder (1) increases crime by 
signalling low social control to offenders and (2) decreases actual social control by reducing willingness to use public spaces.

.pull-left60[

]

.pull-right40[
* A: Disorder signals low guardianship which increases offending.

* B, E: Disorder and crime constrain social relations and impede control.

* C, D: Social control inhibits both disorder and crime.
]

.centernote[
*Bi-directional effects make testing this difficult.*

# Collective Efficacy

[Sampson &amp; Raudenbush (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1086/210356) contend that disorder and crime are both manifestations of low collective efficacy—the community's capacity for informal social control.
--

.pull-left60[
![Collective Efficacy](img/collective_efficacy_pretty.svg)
]

.pull-right40[
* C, D: Disorder and crime are products of low collective efficacy (social control) which is exogenous (B, E).

* A: Disorder has no direct impact on crime.
]

.centernote[
*This is a simple model--and can test if A, B, or E paths exist*

# Field Experiments (Keizer et al. 2008 *Science*)

* Begin with broken windows hypothesis

* Mechanism: Norm violation weakens goal to act appropriately

* Descriptive norm violation (graffiti) inhibits injunctive norms (theft, littering)

* Conducted six experiments to examine cross-norm effects

* Note: Examining norm violations, not serious crimes

---
# Keizer et al. (2008)

Keizer et al. used disorder manipulations and recorded norm violation with field experiments in Grongingen, the Netherlands. 

Multiple interventions show a consistent positive relationship with norm violation.

.pull-right[
* Powerful causal effect of disorder on multiple forms of norm violation (A).

* Single sites in one city: No examination of context, indirect pathways, or reciprocal effects.
]

*Can these be replicated in other locations? What is the influence of context?*

* Embed experiments in disparate Seattle neighborhoods
* Replicate and extend Keizer et al. (2008) and Sampson &amp; Raudenbush (1999)

???

Paths E and C are hard to isolate

Can't use crime as an intervention

Crime is a rare event to observe

Sanctioning is difficult intervention

# Mailbox: Method

.pull-left[
.image-75[
![](img/id_treatment.jpg)
]
]


* A letter containing a visible $5 bill is left near mailbox for passersby to encounter.

--

* Litter and a sign board with graffiti are introduced to manipulate disorder.

--

* Researchers record whether participants mail, steal, or ignore the envelope.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[[1] Perceived sex, age, and group size of participants were also recorded to adjust for compositional differences of tracts.]

--

* We conducted 405 trials with 3,671 participants in 20 Seattle census tracts.

# Mailbox: Results


&lt;table style="width:70%"&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style="font-size:115%" colspan="5"&gt;Mailbox: Participant Actions&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

    &lt;th&gt;Walk-By&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Mail&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Theft&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td rowspan="2"&gt;Control&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1629&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;208&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;33&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;87.1%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.1%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.8%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

    &lt;td rowspan="2"&gt;Treatment&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1637&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;136&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;28&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;90.9%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.6%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.6%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Key Findings:

* Disorder has no impact on theft.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[[1] There is no significant positive relationship in *any* location.]
--

* Disorder reduces the likelihood of mailing—resulting in the letter remaining on the ground longer.

--

* Collective efficacy is associated with lower theft, but not more mailing.

# Summary


* No disorder effect on theft (unable to replicate Keizer et al. 2008).

* Disorder attenuates mailing letters--low risk prosocial behavior (mailbox)
   * Perhaps disorder undermines informal social control--as suggested by Broken Windows.
   * *However, disorder had no effect on sanctioning--higher risk prosocial behavior (littering)*

* Context matters for prosocial behavior
   * Letter addresses affect mail back rates (lost letter)
   * *Race / gender of litterer effects sanctioning (littering)*
   
* Collective efficacy is associated with fewer thefts (mailbox)

* Collective efficacy is associated with mailing back letters (lost letter)

---
# Preliminary Results: Mailbox Experiment

* Much lower theft rate in Seattle vs. Groningen
   * Despite property crime being higher in Seattle
   * Many more people walk by and do nothing
* Disorder does not increase theft
* Disorder reduces mailing
* theft is lower in high collective efficacy neighborhoods

???

ROSS NOTES:

Treatment reduces prob of mailing, no effect on stealing, increases no action.
- If we remove no action and run a logistic regression, treatment appears to increase thefts
because of this.
As expected, men more likely to steal.
Unsure of non-white effect, probably due to tract effects.
People in groups much less likely to act, possibly due to distraction. Noteworthy that people
in groups are counted individually rather than as a mass, so a group of 5 missing the letter is
big.
CE impacts stealing and no action
Busier areas have lower action counts; bystander effect or distraction (cognitive overload)



---
# Conclusion about Broken Windows

* There may be a smal effect of neighborhood disorder on crime

* CE plays an important role in cleaning up disorder

* Probably does not justify zero tolerance policing as panacea

* Unanticipated negative consequences
   * Police dislike focusing on incivilities
   * Potential for racial profiling
   * Undermines citizen-police relations

* Building CE may be more efficient
