# Definition of Genocide

Article 2, UN Genocide Convention:

&gt; Genocide is any of the following five acts committed with **intent to destroy**, in whole or in part, a national **ethnic**, **racial**, or **religious** group:

???

The definition of genocide was coined by Lemkin in 1944. The legal definition--based on Lemkin's work--used by the UN was established by the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.

Note the intent is important. This is the *mens rea* of genocide from early in the course. For it to be genocide, there must be evidence the perpetrators intend to destroy the group.

--

* Killing group members

???

Most commonly seen component. It has been described as a "near universal" that genocides involve killing men and young boys--those who might be in a position to fight.

--

* Causing serious bodily or mental harm to group members

???

Torture, both physical and psychological is common in genocide. Sexual violence (rape) is a component of most genocides. Sexual slavery also occurs.

--

* Deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to destroy the group as a whole or in part

???

This includes acts that do not directly kill but are likely to result in deaths, like concentration camps, deprivation of water and food, death marches, and destruction of settlements and property.

--

* Imposing measures intended to prevent births

???

These are attempts to wipe out a group by preventing procreation. This includes sterilization, separation of men and women, as well as rape for the purpose of producing children of the attacker's race or ethnicity.

--

* Forcible transferring children of the group to another group

???

Transferring of children is about cultural destruction. This also includes enlistment of boy soldiers as well as sexual slavery of female children and youth.

Any of these acts serve as the *actus reus* or guilty act of genocide. The mens rea--intent--plus actus reus--act, compose the crime of genocide.

---
# Genocide in Darfur

* Competition between settled bBlack African and nomadic Arab tribes

   * Land, cattle, horses, and other resources
   * Intensified by desertification
   * Janjaweed (with Sudan government) vs. Black African insurgents

???

Interracial violence was longstanding in Sudan, rooted in conflicts between agricultural Black African tribes and pastoral Arab tribes. These groups are similar to outsiders: Share a religion, phenotypically similar. Linguistically and culturally different; government is predominantly Arabic.

Conflict over resources; intensified by overuse of resources and climate change resulting in shrinking grazing land.

Primary military forces in play were Janjaweed militias back by govt and scattered Black African insurgents; presence of insurgents frequently used as justification for Janjaweed violence.

--

Joint organization:

* Arming of Arab Janjaweed militias by government in 2003
* Bombing of African villages by Sudanese government
* Government forces join Janjaweed militias in ground attacks

???

Collaboration between the Janjaweed and Sudanese government was complex and commonplace. The government armed the militias, enabled leaders, and provided direct assistance with the military from the air and ground. The general idea here is Sudan needed additional, race-pure, forces to run conflict but could support with military.

--

Actus reus:

* Sexual violence and other atrocities
* Confiscation of property (animals, grain, seed, equipment)
* Displacement of Black Africans into internal displacement camps
* Resettlement of Black African regions by Arabs

???

Beyond direct violence, every element of genocide definition covered in Sudan. Widespread sexual violence. Much taking of property, particularly livestock, which is source of livelihood and status. Displaced Black Africans moved to internal concentration camps, and their land resettled by Arabs--not just from Sudan but also from neighboring Chad. 

---
# Differential Social Organization of Genocide

* Organization against genocide

   * Black African rebels and insurgents
   * The international community (e.g. The UN)
   * The international criminal court (ICC)

???

Organization against genocide in Sudan includes rebel and insurgent Black African forces, who retaliated primarily against Sudanese government targets.

We can also consider the international community--for which the UN is the representative body--and the international criminal court as members of organization against genocide.

--

* Organization in Favor of Genocide

   * Arab Janjaweed "anti-insurgent" militias
   * Sudanese government
   * Arab settlers

???

In favor are most prominently the Janjaweed militias, which bill themselves as anti-insurgents--though as Hagan &amp; Rymond-Richmond note, insurgent attacks appear to largely follow victimization.

Also the Sudanese government, of course, and Arab settlers who gain from the situation but may not take part in fighting.

---
# Collective Action in Favor of Genocide

* Social networks and access to resources

   * Arab Janjaweed &amp; Sudan government forces
   * Arms, facilities, and cooperation
   * External support

???

The resources underlying organization in favor of genocide are strong. There's close direct social ties between militia leaders and government and military officials.

These close ties manifest in both direct cooperation and shared material resources such as firearms, aircraft, vehicles, and logistic chains--delivery of supplies like ammunition, food, water, and other things to support military efforts.

The authors also note some degree of support external to Sudan, such as weapons flowing in via Chad.

--

* Political opportunity: insurgent attacks

???

Collective action frameworks draw attention to the role of political opportunities for mobilization. Insurgent attacks on government bases provide an impetus for a strong retaliation. This is a framing move! They point to an attack by rebels, link rebels to Black African settlers, and this provides justification.

--

* Collective action frames

   * Define the conflict as a collective problem, not an individual grievance
   * Define opposition (Black Africans) as "them" versus "us"
   * Frame injustices committed by "them" as correctable by organized actions against "them" (ethnic cleansing)

???

Building on this opportunity and the general background of conflict, we can imagine a collective action frame. The resource conflict and insurgency are a problem facing the Sudanese Arab community. They define "them" as Black Africans and "us" as Arabs. The injustices committed by them are long-standing exclusion from land and recent insurgency, which can be remedied by removing the rebels and Black Africans from the area. This is an explicitly racist collective action frame.

--

* Social Efficacy

   * Key leaders of Arab militia representing distinct areas
   * Hilal, Dawai, Shineibat, Kushayb
   * Each with strong regional social ties &amp; social efficacy

???

Social efficacy plays a key role in Hagan &amp; Rymond-Richmonds analysis. They describe in detail the backgrounds and roles of four Arab militia leaders. They all have strong social ties in their respective regions, as well as ties linking them to the Sudanese government and each other. They are also described as socially efficacious--they're already effective leaders in other roles and clearly able to motivate their militia bases.

Thus we have a case where we have socially efficacious actors sitting central to the networks of organization in favor of genocide.

---
# Collective Action in Favor of Genocide

* Racism frame: Emotional spark

   * "Us" vs. "Them" in zero-sum game
      * Initially over land, water, and resources
      * Gets transformed into race
   * Demonize and dehumanize African blacks

???

A focus of their analysis is the racist collective action from and the motivating emotional spark that can ignite a "fanatical fury".

This is rooted in the social background of Sudan. Initially it is centered over land, water, and resource. But it shifts into being primarily about racial conflict through purposeful racial framing by the government and efficacious actors. Decades of permitting ethnic conflict to occur and escalate in Darfur intertwined with an ideology of supremacist Arabization. Black Africans are demonized and depicted as subhuman.

--

* Racial epithets

   * Individual racist expressions are transformed into collective racism
   * "Fanatical fury": Collective racist emotion unleashed on dehumanized African blacks
   * Racism: A collective instrument of organized terror
   * Reveal a racist motive and intent (genocide)

---
# The Case for Genocide

* Racial epithets heard during attacks (reflect racial intent)

   * More likely when Sudanese government troops joined with Janjaweed militants
   * "We will eliminate all you blacks"
   * "You will have an Arab baby."

--

* Nearby Arab settlements often ignored in attacks

--

* Bombing and racial epithets combined for greater victimization

--

* State-sponsored murder and rape

---

# Proposed Solution: International Law

* Call on the United Nations to define this as genocide

--

* Call on International Criminal Court

   * Define this as genocide
   * Indict Hillal and others for genocide (Sudan's present, Omar al Bashir was "recently" indicted)
   * End the atrocities by international intervention

---
# A Competing View

* Viewed in historical context, this is a political-economic conflict

   * Decades of conflict over land, water, animals, and other resources.
   * Arab and black identities in Darfur have been fluid for centuries 
   * British colonial rule: Re-tribalization, in which tribes would be designated new homelands

--

* ICC is arbitrarily taking one side over the other

   * Demonizing Arabs
   * Historically atrocities have been committed by both sides

--

* Africanists distrust the ICC

   * Not accountable to anyone
   * Except UN security council, which is dominated by US
   * External intervention will only destabilize the region

--

* Alternative Solution: Internal political negotiation

# Key Takeaways

* Many competing theories on causes of crime

   * Rational decision-making and incentives
   * Bonds to individuals and society
   * Social learning and culture

--

* Much agreement in many areas

   * Social context is key: Disadvantage, instability, and personal ties matter for individuals and communities
      * Communities matter for individuals
   * Agency matters: Despite context, behavior varies widely between and within individuals

--

* Crime is a symptom: Prevention beats treatment

   * Addressing disadvantage, segregation, and opportunity is difficult--but more effective than alternatives
   * Incarceration is inefficient and harmful
   * Changing in policing often have little impact
