# Overview

  Objectives
    Understand context and objectives of classical theorists
    Understand their assumptions
  Historical Background
    18th century Europe was unjust, brutal, trampling on individual rights
    Enlightenment: Reason and rationality
    Reform system to protect rights
    Beccaria, Bentham
  Theoretical Assumptions
    Free will, hedonism, rationality
    Consensus in society: protect individual rights and property rights
    Social contract: exchange some freedom for protection of rights
    Punishment by state
  Principles of Justice
    Punishment
      Curtal severity
      Proportional severity
      Retribution and deterrence, not reform as goal
    Criminal Law
      Terms of social contract
      Minimization of law
        "To prohibit an action unnecessarily increases rather than decreases crime." (Radnowitz 9)
    Administration
      No ex-post facto legislation
      Minimal discretion
      Protection of rights: Notice of charges, lawyers, presumption of innocence
    Crime Prevention
      Moral education [non-structural assumption]
      Punishment is last resort
  Criticisms
    Marxist critique
      Reforms achieve justice only in egalitarian society
      Capitalist mode of production is unequal
      Law is part of capitalist superstructure
        Protects and legitimizes system, serves wealthy; white collar crime not punished
    Feminist
      Patriarchy
        Control by men
        Has lessened in US but inequities in wages, politics, family
      Law reproduces patriarchy
        Domestic violence is private affair, not treated seriously
        Common law ruled out spousal rape
        Law maintains status quo
        Equal rights amendement
      Equality
    Critical Race Theory
      Civil rights
        Ended over discrimination buit didn't change historical legacy or social structure; institutional discrimination survives
      Law reproduces status quo
        Hard to address institutional discrimination
        Some areas of law racially biased
      Equality
    [All critical angles have an equality, structural problem component]
