# Historical Background
  
---
# 18th Century Europe

A "successful despotism", characterized by:

* Arbitrary power of aristocracy and church

* Laws against criticism of state and religion.

* Militarized police with extensive spying

* Torture widespread for compelling testimony or doling punishment

* Secret accusations and presumption of guilt

* Widespread corruption

---
# The Enlightenment

A philosophical and scientific response to the social context of continental Europe.

Grounding: Reason and empiricism

Values: Liberty, progress, and religious tolerance

Goals: Reform system to protect individual rights

Results: Undermined authority of monarchy and church

* Not necessarily democratic
* Plato's "philosopher king"

---
# Beccaria

*On Crimes and Punishments* was a reformist manifesto and indictment of European justice system.

--

Like virtually all influential works, composed in conversation with other thinkers and rooted in context.

* Inspired by English justice system
* Social contract from John Locke and Thomas Hobbes

--

In turn, widely influential:

* Jeremy Bentham, most directly
* US "Founding Fathers"

--

Like most academic work we will study, it begins with a series of strong assumptions.

Proposed policies emerge logically from these assumptions.

---
class: inverse
# Theoretical Assumptions

---
# Human Behavior (Micro)

Individuals are rational maximizers:

--

* Free Will

   + There are no external influences on behavior
   + Therefore, people are *responsible* for their behavior

--

* Hedonism

   + People seek pleasure
   + People avoid pain

--

* Rationality

   + People evaluate the consequences of all potential actions
   + They choose the result with highest pleasure and least pain

*Individuals know what is best for them and act accordingly.*

---
# Utilitarianism (Macro)

Bentham: "it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong."

--

If individuals know best how to satisfy their needs and wants...

... to maximize the utility of all, we should restrict people minimally.

--

This breaks down if individuals maximize utility at the expense of others.

---
# Social Contract

Consensus in society: Protect individual rights and property rights

+ Maximize individual utility

Social contract: exchange some freedom for protection of rights

+ Restrict behavior 

Punishment is *only* justified by social contract.

No basis to restrict behavior which does not infringe on others' wellbeing.

* Beccaria: Legalize suicide; abolish death penalty

* Bentham: Legalize homosexual sex; grant women's suffrage

---
class: inverse
# Principles of Justice

---
# Punishment

Curtail severity

Proportional severity
  
  * Crimes against property punished by fines
  * Imprisonment when the crime deprives others of freedom

*Deterrence* not reform as goal

  * Just sufficiently severe to prevent crime
  * Make world a better place, not exact vengeance]
  
Goal: *Make crime the illogical choice.*

---
# Criminal Law

Terms of social contract

* Clear delineation of expectations

Minimization of law

* 

"To prohibit an action unnecessarily increases rather than decreases crime." (Radnowitz 9)

---
# Administration

No ex-post facto legislation

Minimal discretion

* Fully described laws and punishments
* Judges only determine if a law was broken
* Punishments uniform regardless of circumstances of offender

Protection of rights

* Notice of charges
* Guaranteed Counsel
* Presumption of innocence

---
# Crime Prevention

Moral education

Reward good behavior

Punishment is last resort

* Certainty, not severity, critical element for prevention

[non-structural assumption]

---
class: inverse
# Criticisms

---
# Marxist critique

Reforms achieve justice only in egalitarian society

Capitalist mode of production is unequal

Law is part of capitalist superstructure

* Protects and legitimizes system
* Serves wealthy
   + White collar crime not punished

---
# Feminist

Patriarchy

* Government and law controlled by men

* Has lessened in US but inequities in wages, politics, family persist

Law reproduces patriarchy

* Domestic violence is private affair, not treated seriously

* Common law ruled out spousal rape

* Law maintains status quo

* Equal rights amendment

*Should strive for equality*
    
---  
# Critical Race Theory

Civil rights

* Suppressed overt discrimination
* Did not change historical legacy or social structure
* Institutional discrimination survives
  
Law reproduces status quo

* Hard to address institutional discrimination
* Some areas of law racially biased

*Should strive for equality*
      
---
# Critical Summary

Main critical viewpoints share a logic:

1. Structural problems exist

   + Source and form of problems differs
   + e.g. capitalism; patriarchy; colonialism or white supremacy

2. Law protects existing structure

3. Equality should be goal

   + Vision of equality different under each critique
   
4. Equality can be achieved only through dismantling existing structure

# For Next Time

### Readings: 

* Kauzlarich, David, and David O. Friedrichs. 2005. "Definitions of Crime." 

* Hemmens, Craig. 2005. "Defenses to Criminal Liability: Justifications and Excuses" 

### Things to pay attention to:

1. Definitions of Crime

* These matters for how we study it, and what criminality means.

2. Departures from Classical School

* Context matters
* Crime may not be result of rational process
* External influences may exist
