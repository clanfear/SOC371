# Overview

1. Context for Deterrence and Rational Choice

2. Deterrence Theory

   * Certainty, Severity, Celerity
   * General vs. Specific

3. Rational Choice Theory

4. Matseuda, Kreager, &amp; Huzinga (2006)


---
# Context

* Criticism of the classical school lead to rejection of rational actor

???

Went a little far--more structural, more deterministic theories--often called "oversocialized" perspectives.

--

* Criminology dominated by subcultural theories well into 1970s--even 1980s.
    + Crime as irrational behavior resulting from socialization

???

These include differential association, differential opportunity, strain theory, etc.

Subcultural theories usually focus on normative conflict or difference: Crime occurs because people are members of subcultures that reject conventional norms and have pro-crime norms.

--

* Attacks on rehabilitation in 70's and 80's

    + Focus on deterring crime rather than fixing criminals

???

Move toward rehabilitative model in 1960s and onward was not associated with dropping crime

People became pessimistic--"there's nothing to be done"--so just lock folks up and throw away key

--

* James Q. Wilson's (1975) *Thinking About Crime*

    + Respond harshly so those on fence don't get idea that crime pays.

???

James Q. Wilson was influential political scientist and policy writer. Focused on crime a lot.

Thinking About Crime introduced idea of incapacitation as mechanism for crime reduction in places with higher penalties.

Wrote original Broken Windows article with George Kelling and was pro War on Drugs on moral grounds.

--


*Rather than focus on the intervening work first, we begin at **deterrence**.*

---
# Deterrence and Rationality

Deterrence is framed now in terms of rational choice but has long been basis from criminal legal policy

* Classical school foundation

???

As seen in week 1, deterrence goes back to Beccaria and Bentham.

It entered US CJ policy at foundation of nation and hasn't gone anywhere. More or less same into Europe.

--

* Gary Becker's (1968) Economic Model of Crime

???

First well-known general utility model of crime.

Becker was focusing on optimal calibration of punishment in CJ system--mostly deterrence

--

* Bringing agency back in

???

Swinging pendulum back to actors as being decision-makers and away from deterministic cultural theories

--

* Rational choice reintroduced classical model in more realistic terms
    + People are *on average* rational
    + People respond to incentives
    + Structural position and context matter

???

People do not pick optimal choice every time but do on average

Key is that people respond to incentives

--

* Since criminal behavior seems irrational, it is a "hard test" for a theory of rational actors


???

If rational choice can explain criminality well, it can likely explain more rational things as well




---
#  Deterrence Doctrine

Deterrence is simply idea that punishment can impact crime.

   + People *respond to incentives*

Weaker assumptions than classical school

Rational actor assumptions:

* In **aggregate**, individuals act rationally

???

If you look at large groups together, on average they behave rationally

--

* At **margin**, individuals act rationally

???

People may not act perfectly rationally, but they do respond 

If punishment increases, people will commit less crime; if gains increase, more.

--

*Crime can be controlled by increasing its cost*

---
# Marginal vs. Absolute

* Absolute Deterrence

   + Deterrent effect of a penalty vs. no penalty
   + *Will decriminalizing drugs result in more drug use?*

???

This is question of whether *any penalty at all* has an effect on a behavior.

--

* Marginal Deterrence

   + Deterrent effect of a penalty compared to different penalty
   + *Does the death penalty reduce more crime than life sentences?*

???

This is if increasing or decreasing penalties increases or decreases behavior.

---
# Variables in Deterrence

* Certainty

   + Probability of being sanctioned
   + Objective Measures:
       * Arrest or clearance rate
       * Proportion of offenders prosecuted
   + Subjective Measures: Perceived punishment probability
   + Tittle's "Shell of Illusion"

???


Tittle's Shell of Illusion: Those never committing a crime--and thus never getting away with it--overestimate sanction risk.

This is related to the illusion most people have that certain types of law violation are incredibly rare; since at least Rome philosophers have stated that if people knew how often laws were broken, they too would break them.

--

* Severity

   + Severity of the sanction
   + This is the *cost*
   + Objective Measures: Sentence length; fine amount
   + Subjective Measure: Perceived suffering
   
???

Subjective usually involves asking people "how bad would it be to be arrested / incarcerated"

--

* Celerity (Swiftness)

   + Length of time between crime and sanction
   
???

Not often used

Time discounting in economics--a loss or gain in the future is worth less than one now

Not real relevant in US system due to everything being slow

The slowness may actually be a severity component too

# General vs. Specific Deterrence

---
# General Deterrence

*Does threat of punishment deter people from crime?*

   + Perceived threat of sanctions deters individuals from crime
   + Based on perception, not personal experience
   + Punish so that others see they too will be punished
   + About reducing *crime in general*

--

Research Approaches

   + Changes in crime rates before/after policy changes
   + Effects of perceived risk and severity

---
# Specific Deterrence

Does punishment deter punished people?

   + Experience of punishment deters individuals from future crime
   + Based on experience, occurs only after punishment
   + About reducing *recidivism*

--

Research Approaches

   + Compare incarcerated then released vs. probationers
       + But those sent to prison may be more crime prone
       + Experimental design: Need equivalent treatment and control groups
   + Randomly vary punishment
   + Look at marginal cases--natural experiments
       + Same crime probation vs. incarceration





---
# Rational Choice Model

Deterrence focuses on the sanctioning.

Rational choice is a *general* theory of behavior--not limited to crime.

--

Full rational choice models recognize variation in gains.
   
   + Includes material and psychic gains
   + e.g. Piliavin, Thornton, Gartner, &amp; Matsueda (1986)

???

Article found better support for rational response to rewards than to formal deterrence

Later work often shows similar--may be due to low risk of apprehension

# Formalization

Rational choice models typically take a formal mathematical form.

$$
E(U) = (1-p)U(y)+pU(y-F)
$$
"Expected utility `\(E(U)\)` is function of the value of crime `\(U(y)\)`, the likelihood of being caught `\(p\)`, and the penalty if caught `\(F\)`"

???

This is conventional economic utility model

Don't estimate exact values, but rather take advantage of basic properties

All else equal, reducing reward / increasing cost reduces value and thus likelihood of crime.

--

Becker (1968) introduced rational model of crime

   + Little impact in sociology or criminology.
   + Assumed full information
   + Material gains compared to gains from legitimate job

???

First major economic treatment of crime as rational behavior

Mainly focused on criminal justice policy

--

Short &amp; Strodtbeck (1964) -- decision to join a gang fight

   + Subjective probability of harm
   + Bounded rationality
   + Status and psychic rewards

???

Mixed methods work revealing participation in gang fights as rational behavior

Gang leader decides whether or not to join a fight

If he decides not to, likely he will suffer small to medium, status loss

IF he does, small chance he will need to shoot someone and end up in jail -- large cost

Because likelihood of jail is small, he'll probably join fight--it is rational to do so

---
# Premise

Rational choice hypothesis: Perceived cost/benefit *impacts* future crime

* Crime = Pr `\(*\)` Value(Reward) &gt; Pr `\(*\)` Value(Costs) 

???

That is, crime occurs when reward weighted by likelihood of getting it is higher than sanction risk weighted by likelihood.

--

Research Questions:

* How are perceived risks formed? 

* How do perceived risks and rewards influence crime?

--

Data: Denver Youth Survey

* Annual panel survey of high-risk youth
* Self-reported delinquency and crime
* Perceived risk of arrest
* Perceived rewards of crime

---
# Theory

Deterrence: Perceptions should be rooted in reality

* Experiential Learning
    + Baseline estimate of perceived risk is overestimated (Tittle 1980)
    + New information used to update

???

Perceived risks come from real experiences

Those who have never committed a crime think they're likely to be caught

When they get away with it, they update perceptions--this is a Bayesian updating model

--
      
* Measure for Perceived Arrest Risk
    + Experienced certainty: Arrests/Crimes for each person
    + Unsanctioned offenses: number of crimes for non-arrested
    + Crimes of peers

???

DYS has actual arrests and committed crimes for respondents

Know number of unsanctioned offenses

Also know crimes of their peers--we assume peers getting away with it (or being sanctioned) gives info

IMAGE Rat Choice and deterrence

---
  Rewards: Excitement, seen as cool
      Cost: Arrest
      Certainty: Chance of getting X for theft (violence)?
      Severity: How good or bad is this?
    Graphical mode: Perceived risk of arrest on crime
    Conclusion:
      Small deterrent effect: 10% risk equals 3% theft and 5% violence reduction
      10% seen as cool reduces theft by 6, violence by 7
      Already have high arrest and imprisonment rate--bad idea to boost it
      Some level of arrest and incarceration probably essential
      Deterrence not a panacea for crime problem.
