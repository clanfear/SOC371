## Overview

This course provides an introduction to sociological criminology. We
begin by defining crime and law, then surveying criminology’s classical
foundations. The majority of the course will then be spent studying
modern sociological theories of crime. This course emphasizes the
underlying causal models of these theories, corresponding assumptions,
and levels of explanation–structural, neighborhood, group, and
individual. We will study these theories mainly with primary source
material–the words of the original theorists and later contributors. We
will also relate these theories to real-world social problems and
policies, such as policing, mass incarceration, gun violence, genocide,
and segregation.

### Course Objectives

-   Provide you with an understanding of basic theories, concepts, and
    methods used by criminologists.

-   Show you how criminological theories apply to real-world phenomena.

-   Make you a critical consumer of claims about crime and crime
    policies in the news, social media, and political campaigns.

-   Develop your critical and analytical skills through discussion and
    written assignments.

### [Course Website](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC371/)

[clanfear.github.io/SOC371/](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC371/)

The course website is accessible without a UWnetID and features all of
the slides, links to readings, and assignments. Note many readings are,
however, pay-walled and require a UWnetID to access. These can be found
on the Canvas site or accessed via the UW Library. [See this page for
instructions for adding a UW Library proxy to your browser for
off-campus access to
articles.](https://www.lib.washington.edu/help/connect/tools) Lecture
videos will be posted within 36 hours of recording.

### [Course Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1436108)

The course Canvas will be used to access some readings, post discussion
questions, and submit assignments. Do not use Canvas messages for
communication with the instructor or TA–it will not be monitored.

## Course Requirements

Grades will be assessed with the following breakdown:

|         Item         | Number | Percent of Grade |
|:--------------------:|:------:|:----------------:|
| Course Participation |   10   |        15        |
| Discussion Questions |   17   |        15        |
|    Midterm Exams     |   2    |        40        |
|      Final Exam      |   1    |        30        |

A score of at least 95% will guarantee a 4.0 in the course. Every 2.0
percentage points below 95 (rounded *down*) will correspond to a .1
difference in the final grade (e.g. 89% or 90% is a 3.7). You can
calculate this yourself:

*Your Final Grade* = 4 - (95 - *Your Overall Percentage*) / 20

#### Participation

Students are expected to complete readings and engage in discussion
during sections. Given the disruption presented by COVID-19, alternate
evaluation is possible for students unable to attend one or more
(including *all*) synchronous section meetings. Alternate evaluation
takes the form of reading responses which *must not exceed 500 words or
150 per reading (whichever is greater)* and should contain *for each
reading*:

1.  A basic summary of the reading
2.  And one or both of:
    1.  A personal reaction to the reading. That is, do you think the
        theory, its assumptions, and/or policy implications make sense
        or are missing important elements?
    2.  A comparison and contrast with earlier readings and lecture
        content. You should make a statement about which you find more
        plausible and why.

Note that each section covers the readings for the *entire week*. If you
were to miss the February 3rd section, your reading response would need
to cover the February 1st reading and the two February 3rd readings (3
readings total). Note you can use a bit of extra space for weeks with
many (4+) readings to a total of 150 per reading (e.g. 600 word for 4
readings, 750 for 5). You don’t need to write the same on each (150 per)
but rather just total up to the cap. Contact us if you are unclear what
the cap is.

Please submit reading responses as a file attachment to the relevant
participation assignment. Reading responses are due by 5 PM on the day
of section (Wednesday). Reading responses do not take the place of
discussion questions. Students must still submit discussion questions.

#### Discussion Questions

Students will be required to submit two discussion questions via Canvas
prior to each lecture meeting. Please submit as text in the available
entry boxes on Canvas. These questions will be used to facilitate
section discussions (and occasionally lecture clarifications). Questions
should be open-ended and reflect engagement with the material–that is,
they delve deeper into ideas presented in the reading or raise critical
questions. Questions are due by 5 PM the day before (i.e. 5 PM Sunday
for Monday lecture’s readings). If there are multiple readings, each
question should address a different reading. Regardless of the number of
readings, please always provide two questions.

#### Exams

There will be two midterm and one final exam. Exams will focus on
application of concepts rather than regurgitation of knowledge.
Consequently, they are open book and you will have a few days to work on
them. The format will consist of a number of short answer and essay
questions. Students are expected to reference course readings with clear
citations, e.g. “Shaw & McKay (1942) proposed delinquent subcultures as
a mechanism for stability in neighborhood crime rates.” Students may
refer to other materials, but should do so sparingly and not to the
exclusion of relevant course material. If material from outside the
course is cited, you must add a *Works Cited* section at the end of the
exam with a full, properly formatted (e.g. ASA format) citation for the
work.

Exams must be submitted to Canvas as a raw text (e.g. .txt) or common
word processing document (e.g. .docx). Files that are “corrupt” or
cannot be opened will be treated as handed in at the time a readable
file is received. You may send the instructor a test file to open if you
are unsure about file format compatibility. There are no minimum length
requirements and maximums will be by question-specific word count, so
don’t waste your time playing with fonts, formatting, or margins.
Exceeding the maximum word length for an answer will result in score
deductions.

## Course Texts and Readings

There is no textbook for this course. Rather, there are two required
books documenting important studies in criminology–books you are likely
to find on the shelf of a respectable criminologist. Both books are
freely available as eBooks through the UW library and affordable in
print.

-   [Divergent Social Worlds (2010) Ruth D. Peterson & Lauren J.
    Krivo](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71175976510001451)

-   [Darfur and the Crime of Genocide (2009) John Hagan & Wenona
    Rymond-Richmond](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71240618630001451)

Other readings will be available via files posted on Canvas and links on
the course website. These readings will primarily be academic journal
articles. Note that journal articles are targeted at academic audiences.
It is likely you will find them challenging to read and may not
understand everything discussed–this is fine! Allot yourself more time
for article reading than you would for a textbook chapter of comparable
length. At the end of each lecture you will also receive a brief
overview of what to expect and look for in the readings for the next
lecture. If you find an article–or section of an article–particularly
challenging or unclear, please contact the teaching assistant, come to
office hours to chat, or bring it up in discussion.

## Content Warning

The content in this course engages with many emotionally and
intellectually challenging topics, such as racism, sexism, violence
including sexual violence, incarceration, and genocide. I will do my
best to make the classroom environment a welcoming environment for
confronting these topics. Do not hesitate to reach out if you have
questions or concerns about encountering any course material.

## Contacting the Instructor

You are encouraged to contact me via email with questions or concerns.
Note, it may take up to 48 weekday hours to respond to your email.

## Accommodation Policy

Your experience in this class is important to me. The policies below
cover accommodations for disability or religious activities. If you have
other concerns related to participating in this class–such as difficulty
with course materials or the pace of the course– please contact me. I
want this course to be maximally useful and accessible to all students.

### Religious Activities

Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation
of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or
conscience, or for organized religious activities. Accommodations must
be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the
Religious Accommodations Request form available at:
<https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/>

### Disability Access

It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create
inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal
and state law. If you experience barriers based on disability, [please
seek a meeting with DRS to discuss and address
them](http://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/). If you have already
established accommodations with DRS, please communicate your approved
accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your
needs in this course. Disability Resources for Students (DRS) offers
resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with
disabilities. Reasonable accommodations are established through an
interactive process between you, your instructor (me) and DRS. DRS
information can be found at: <http://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/>

## Late Work Policy

Late assignments will be penalized by 25% per day without official
documentation of an unavoidable cause for absence or inability to
complete the assignment on time. Valid unavoidable causes are limited to
those described in [Student Governance Policies Chapter 112, Subsection
1.B](http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/SGP/ScholRegCH112.html).
Discussion questions are not eligible for late turn-in (without
documentation of unavoidable cause) and will receive a zero if submitted
after the due time without prior approval.

## Academic Misconduct Policy

As a University of Washington student, you are bound by the university’s
[student conduct
policy](http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/SGP/SPCH209.html).
Academic misconduct, including plagiarism–which includes copying any
material from any source including fellow students without
attribution–will be referred to the Community Standards & Student
Conduct office. If you are not sure a particular practice is acceptable,
please contact me via email or in office hours.
