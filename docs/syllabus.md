## Overview

This course provides an introduction to sociological criminology. We
begin by defining crime and law, then surveying criminology’s classical
foundations. The majority of the course will then be spent studying
modern sociological theories of crime. This course emphasizes the
underlying causal models of these theories, corresponding assumptions,
and levels of explanation–structural, neighborhood, group, and
individual. We will study these theories with primary source
material–the words of their originators and key contributors. We will
also relate these theories to real-world social problems and policies,
such as policing, mass incarceration, gun violence, genocide, and
segregation.

### Course Objectives

  - Provide you with an understanding of basic theories, concepts, and
    methods used by criminologists.

  - Show you how criminological theories apply to real-world phenomena.

  - Make you a critical consumer of media reports and politicians’
    claims about crime and crime policies.

  - Develop your critical and analytical skills through discussion and
    written assignments.

### [Course Website](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC371/)

[clanfear.github.io/SOC371/](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC371/)

The course website is accessible without a UWnetID and features all of
the slides, links to readings, and assignments. Note many readings are
pay-walled and require a UWnetID to access. [See this page for
instructions for adding a UW Library proxy to your browser for
off-campus access to
articles.](https://www.lib.washington.edu/help/connect/tools)

### [Course Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1382874)

The course Canvas will be used to access some readings, post discussion
questions, and submit assignments. Do not use Canvas messages for
communication with the instructor–it will not be monitored for messages.

## Course Requirements

Grades will be assessed with the following breakdown:

|         Item         | Number | Percent of Grade |
| :------------------: | :----: | :--------------: |
| Discussion Questions |   16   |        20        |
|    Midterm Exams     |   2    |        40        |
|      Final Exam      |   1    |        40        |

A score of at least 95% will guarantee a 4.0 in the course. Every 2.5
percentage points below 95 will correspond to a .1 difference in the
final grade (e.g. 90/100 is a 3.8).

#### Discussion Questions

Students will be required to submit two discussion questions via Canvas
prior to each lecture meeting. These questions will be used to
facilitate post-lecture discussion. Questions should be open-ended and
reflect engagement with the material–that is, they delve deeper into
ideas presented in the reading or raise critical questions. Questions
are due by 6 PM the day before (i.e. 6 PM Sunday for Monday lecture’s
readings). If there are multiple readings, each question should address
a different reading.

#### Exams

There will be two midterm and one final exam. Exams will focus on
application of concepts rather than regurgitation of knowledge.
Consequently, they are open book and you will have at least a day to
work on them. The format will consist of a number of short answer and
small essay questions. Students are expected to reference course
readings with clear citations, e.g. “Shaw & McKay (1942) proposed
delinquent subcultures as a mechanism for stability in neighborhood
crime rates.” Students may refer to other materials, but should do so
sparingly and not the exclusion of relevant course material.

## Course Texts

There is no textbook for this course. Rather, there are two required
books documenting important studies in criminology. Both of books are
freely available as eBooks through the UW library and affordable in
print.

## Content Warning

The content in this course engages with many emotionally and
intellectually challenging topics, such as racism, sexism, violence,
incarceration, and genocide. I will do my best to make the classroom
environment a welcoming environment for confronting these topics. Do not
hesitate to reach out if you have questions or concerns about
encountering any course material.

You are encouraged to contact my via email with questions or concerns.
Note, it may take up to 48 weekday hours to respond to your email.
