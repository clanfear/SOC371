# SOC 371: Criminology

### Summer 2020

Instructor: [Charles Lanfear](mailto:clanfear@uw.edu)

## Class Meetings

[**Lecture Zoom**: Monday / Wednesday
9:40-11:50](https://washington.zoom.us/j/97380045367)

[**Office Hours**: Tuesday: 12:00 -
1:30](https://washington.zoom.us/j/2979554878)

## Overview

This course provides an introduction to sociological criminology. We
begin by defining crime and law, then surveying criminology’s classical
foundations. The majority of the course will then be spent studying
modern sociological theories of crime. This course emphasizes the
underlying causal models of these theories, corresponding assumptions,
and levels of explanation–structural, neighborhood, group, and
individual. We will study these theories mainly with primary source
material–the words of the original theorists and later contributors. We
will also relate these theories to real-world social problems and
policies, such as policing, mass incarceration, gun violence, genocide,
and segregation.

### Course Objectives

  - Provide you with an understanding of basic theories, concepts, and
    methods used by criminologists.

  - Show you how criminological theories apply to real-world phenomena.

  - Make you a critical consumer of claims about crime and crime
    policies in the news, social media, and political campaigns.

  - Develop your critical and analytical skills through discussion and
    written assignments.

### [Course Website](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC371/)

[clanfear.github.io/SOC371/](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC371/)

The course website is accessible without a UWnetID and features all of
the slides, links to readings, and assignments. Note many readings are,
however, pay-walled and require a UWnetID to access. [See this page for
instructions for adding a UW Library proxy to your browser for
off-campus access to
articles.](https://www.lib.washington.edu/help/connect/tools) Lecture
videos will be posted within 36 hours of recording.

### [Course Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1382874)

The course Canvas will be used to access some readings, post discussion
questions, and submit assignments. Do not use Canvas messages for
communication with the instructor–it will not be monitored.

## Course Requirements

Grades will be assessed with the following breakdown:

|         Item         | Number | Percent of Grade |
| :------------------: | :----: | :--------------: |
| Course Participation |   18   |        10        |
| Discussion Questions |   17   |        20        |
|    Midterm Exams     |   2    |        40        |
|      Final Exam      |   1    |        30        |

A score of at least 95% will guarantee a 4.0 in the course. Every 2.5
percentage points below 95 will correspond to a .1 difference in the
final grade (e.g. 90/100 is a 3.8).

#### Participation

Students are expected to complete readings and engage in discussion.
Given the disruption presented by COVID-19, alternate evaluation is
possible for students unable to attend one or more synchronous lectures.
Students must contact the instructor prior to absences to be considered
for alternate evaluation below. Alternate evaluation *must not exceed
one page total* (but you will likely need 350+ words) and should contain
*for each reading*:

1.  A basic summary of the reading
2.  And one or more of:
    1.  A personal reaction to the reading. That is, do you think the
        theory, its assumptions, and/or policy implications make sense
        or are missing important elements?
    2.  A comparison and contrast with earlier readings and lecture
        content. You should make a statement about which you find more
        plausible and why.

#### Discussion Questions

Students will be required to submit at least two discussion questions
via Canvas prior to each lecture meeting. These questions will be used
to facilitate post-lecture discussion. Questions should be open-ended
and reflect engagement with the material–that is, they delve deeper into
ideas presented in the reading or raise critical questions. Questions
are due by 5 PM the day before (i.e. 5 PM Sunday for Monday lecture’s
readings). If there are multiple readings, each question should address
a different reading.

#### Exams

There will be two midterm and one final exam. Exams will focus on
application of concepts rather than regurgitation of knowledge.
Consequently, they are open book and you will have at least a day to
work on them. The format will consist of a number of short answer and
essay questions. Students are expected to reference course readings with
clear citations, e.g. “Shaw & McKay (1942) proposed delinquent
subcultures as a mechanism for stability in neighborhood crime rates.”
Students may refer to other materials, but should do so sparingly and
not the exclusion of relevant course material. If material from outside
the course is cited, you must add a *Works Cited* section at the end of
the exam with a full, properly formatted (e.g. ASA format) citation for
the work.

Exams must be submitted to Canvas as a raw text (e.g. .txt) or common
word processing document (e.g. .docx). Files that are “corrupt” or
cannot be opened will be treated as handed in at the time a readable
file is received. You may send the instructor a test file to open if you
are unsure about file format compatibility. There are no minimum length
requirements and maximums will be by word count, so don’t waste your
time playing with fonts, formatting, or margins.

## Course Texts and Readings

There is no textbook for this course. Rather, there are two required
books documenting important studies in criminology–books you are likely
to find on the shelf of a respectable criminologist. Both books are
freely available as eBooks through the UW library and affordable in
print.

  - [Divergent Social Worlds (2010) Ruth D. Peterson & Lauren J.
    Krivo](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71175976510001451)

  - [Darfur and the Crime of Genocide (2009) John Hagan & Wenona
    Rymond-Richmond](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71240618630001451)

Other readings will be available via files posted on Canvas and links on
the course website. These readings will primarily be academic journal
articles. Note that journal articles are targeted at academic audiences.
It is likely you will find them challenging to read and may not
understand everything discussed–this is fine\! Allot yourself more time
for article reading than you would for a textbook chapter of comparable
length. At the end of each lecture you will also receive a brief
overview of what to expect and look for in the readings for the next
lecture. If you find an article–or section of an article–particularly
challenging or unclear, please contact the instructor, come to office
hours to chat, or bring it up in discussion.

## Content Warning

The content in this course engages with many emotionally and
intellectually challenging topics, such as racism, sexism, violence,
incarceration, and genocide. I will do my best to make the classroom
environment a welcoming environment for confronting these topics. Do not
hesitate to reach out if you have questions or concerns about
encountering any course material.

## Contacting the Instructor

You are encouraged to contact me via email with questions or concerns.
Note, it may take up to 48 weekday hours to respond to your email.

## Accommodation Policy

Your experience in this class is important to me. The policies below
cover accommodations for disability or religious activities. If you have
other concerns related to participating in this class–such as difficulty
with course materials or the pace of the course– please contact me. I
want this course to be maximally useful and accessible to all students.

### Religious Activities

Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation
of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or
conscience, or for organized religious activities. Accommodations must
be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the
Religious Accommodations Request form available at:
<https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/>

### Disability Access

It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create
inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal
and state law. If you experience barriers based on disability, [please
seek a meeting with DRS to discuss and address
them](http://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/). If you have already
established accommodations with DRS, please communicate your approved
accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your
needs in this course. Disability Resources for Students (DRS) offers
resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with
disabilities. Reasonable accommodations are established through an
interactive process between you, your instructor (me) and DRS. DRS
information can be found at: <http://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/>

## Late Work Policy

Late assignments will be penalized by 25% per day without official
documentation of an unavoidable cause for absence or inability to
complete the assignment on time. Valid unavoidable causes are limited to
those described in [Student Governance Policies Chapter 112,
Subsection 1.B](http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/SGP/ScholRegCH112.html).
Discussion questions are not eligible for late turn-in (without
documentation of unavoidable cause) and will receive a zero if submitted
after the due time.

## Academic Misconduct Policy

As a University of Washington student, you are bound by the university’s
[student conduct
policy](http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/SGP/SPCH209.html).
Academic misconduct, including plagiarism–which includes copying any
material from any source including fellow students without
attribution–will be referred to the Community Standards & Student
Conduct office. If you are not sure a particular practice is acceptable,
please contact me via email or in office hours.
