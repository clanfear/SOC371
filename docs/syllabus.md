## Overview

This course provides an introduction to sociological criminology. We
begin by defining crime and law, then surveying criminology’s classical
foundations. The majority of the course will then be spent studying
modern sociological theories of crime. This course emphasizes the
underlying causal models of these theories, corresponding assumptions,
and levels of explanation–structural, neighborhood, group, and
individual. We will study these theories with primary source
material–the words of their originators and key contributors. We will
also relate these theories to real-world social problems and policies,
such as policing, mass incarceration, gun violence, genocide, and
segregation.

### Course Objectives

  - Provide you with an understanding of basic theories, concepts, and
    methods used by criminologists.

  - Show you how criminological theories apply to real-world phenomena.

  - Make you a critical consumer of media reports and politicians’
    claims about crime and crime policies.

  - Develop your critical and analytical skills through discussion and
    written assignments.

### [Course Website](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC371/)

[clanfear.github.io/SOC371/](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC371/)

The course website is accessible without a UWnetID and features all of
the slides, links to readings, and assignments. Note many readings are
pay-walled and require a UWnetID to access. [See this page for
instructions for adding a UW Library proxy to your browser for
off-campus access to
articles.](https://www.lib.washington.edu/help/connect/tools)

### [Course Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1382874)

The course Canvas will be used to access some readings, post discussion
questions, and submit assignments. Do not use Canvas messages for
communication with the instructor–it will not be monitored for messages.

## Course Requirements

Grades will be assessed with the following breakdown:

|         Item         | Number | Percent of Grade |
| :------------------: | :----: | :--------------: |
| Discussion Questions |   16   |        10        |
|    Midterm Exams     |   2    |        40        |
|      Final Exam      |   1    |        30        |
|        Essay         |   1    |        20        |

A score of at least 95% will guarantee a 4.0 in the course. Every 2.5
percentage points below 95 will correspond to a .1 difference in the
final grade (e.g. 90/100 is a 3.8).

intellectually challenging topics, such as racism, sexism, violence,
