# SOC 371: Criminology

### Summer 2020

Instructor: [Charles Lanfear](mailto:clanfear@uw.edu) Office: 255 Savery
Hall

## Class Meetings

**Lecture Zoom**: Monday / Wednesday 9:40-11:50

**Office Hours**: Tuesday: 12:00 - 1:30

## Overview

This course provides an introduction to sociological criminology. We
begin by defining crime and law, then surveying criminology’s classical
foundations. The majority of the course will then be spent studying
modern sociological theories of crime. This course emphasizes the
underlying causal models of these theories, corresponding assumptions,
and levels of explanation–structural, neighborhood, group, and
individual. We will study these theories mainly with primary source
material–the words of the original theorists and later contributors. We
will also relate these theories to real-world social problems and
policies, such as policing, mass incarceration, gun violence, genocide,
and segregation.

### Course Objectives

  - Provide you with an understanding of basic theories, concepts, and
    methods used by criminologists.

  - Show you how criminological theories apply to real-world phenomena.

  - Make you a critical consumer of claims about crime and crime
    policies in the news, social media, and political campaigning.

  - Develop your critical and analytical skills through discussion and
    written assignments.

### [Course Website](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC371/)

[clanfear.github.io/SOC371/](https://clanfear.github.io/SOC371/)

The course website is accessible without a UWnetID and features all of
the slides, links to readings, and assignments. Note many readings are,
however, pay-walled and require a UWnetID to access. [See this page for
instructions for adding a UW Library proxy to your browser for
off-campus access to
articles.](https://www.lib.washington.edu/help/connect/tools)

### [Course Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1382874)

The course Canvas will be used to access some readings, post discussion
questions, and submit assignments. Do not use Canvas messages for
communication with the instructor–it will not be monitored.

## Course Requirements

Grades will be assessed with the following breakdown:

|         Item         | Number | Percent of Grade |
| :------------------: | :----: | :--------------: |
| Course Participation |   18   |        10        |
| Discussion Questions |   16   |        20        |
|    Midterm Exams     |   2    |        40        |
|      Final Exam      |   1    |        30        |

A score of at least 95% will guarantee a 4.0 in the course. Every 2.5
percentage points below 95 will correspond to a .1 difference in the
final grade (e.g. 90/100 is a 3.8).

#### Participation

Students are expected to complete readings and engage in discussion.
Given the disruption presented by COVID-19, alternate evaluation (e.g. a
1-page reading and discussion response) is possible for students unable
to attend a given synchronous lecture. Students must contact the
instructor prior to absences to be considered for alternate evaluation.

#### Discussion Questions

Students will be required to submit at least two discussion questions
via Canvas prior to each lecture meeting. These questions will be used
to facilitate post-lecture discussion. Questions should be open-ended
and reflect engagement with the material–that is, they delve deeper into
ideas presented in the reading or raise critical questions. Questions
are due by 6 PM the day before (i.e. 6 PM Sunday for Monday lecture’s
readings). If there are multiple readings, each question should address
a different reading.

#### Exams

There will be two midterm and one final exam. Exams will focus on
application of concepts rather than regurgitation of knowledge.
Consequently, they are open book and you will have at least a day to
work on them. The format will consist of a number of short answer and
essay questions. Students are expected to reference course readings with
clear citations, e.g. “Shaw & McKay (1942) proposed delinquent
subcultures as a mechanism for stability in neighborhood crime rates.”
Students may refer to other materials, but should do so sparingly and
not the exclusion of relevant course material.

## Course Texts and Readings

There is no textbook for this course. Rather, there are two required
books documenting important studies in criminology–books you are likely
to find on the shelf of a respectable criminologist. Both books are
freely available as eBooks through the UW library and affordable in
print.

  - [Divergent Social Worlds (2010) Ruth D. Peterson & Lauren J.
    Krivo](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71175976510001451)

  - [Darfur and the Crime of Genocide (2009) John Hagan & Wenona
    Rymond-Richmond](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71240618630001451)

Other readings will be available via files posted on Canvas and links on
the course website. These readings will primarily be academic journal
articles. Note that journal articles are targeted at academic audiences.
It is likely you will find them challenging to read and may not
understand everything discussed–this is fine\! Allot yourself more time
for article reading than you would for a textbook chapter of comparable
length. At the end of each lecture you will also receive a brief
overview of what to expect and look for in the readings for the next
lecture. If you find an article–or section of an article–particularly
challenging or unclear, please contact the instructor, come to office
hours to chat, or bring it up in discussion.

## Content Warning

The content in this course engages with many emotionally and
intellectually challenging topics, such as racism, sexism, violence,
incarceration, and genocide. I will do my best to make the classroom
environment a welcoming environment for confronting these topics. Do not
hesitate to reach out if you have questions or concerns about
encountering any course material.

## Contacting the Instructor

You are encouraged to contact my via email with questions or concerns.
Note, it may take up to 48 weekday hours to respond to your email.
