# SOC 371
## Criminology
### University of Washington

Instructor: [Charles Lanfear](mailto:clanfear@uw.edu)
Office: 255 Savery Hall

## Class Meetings 

**Lecture Zoom**: Monday / Wednesday 9:40-11:50

**Office Hours**: Tuesday: 12:00 - 1:30

## Overview

This course provides an introduction to sociological criminology. We begin by defining crime and law, then surveying criminology's classical foundations. The majority of the course will then be spent studying modern sociological theories of crime. This course emphasizes the underlying causal models of these theories, corresponding assumptions, and levels of explanation--structural, neighborhood, group, and individual. We will study these theories with primary source material--the words of their originators and key contributors. We will also relate these theories to real-world social problems and policies, such as policing, mass incarceration, gun violence, genocide, and segregation.

### Course Objectives

* Provide you with an understanding of basic theories, concepts, and methods used by criminologists.

* Show you how criminological theories apply to real-world phenomena.

* Make you a critical consumer of media reports and politiciansâ€™ claims about crime and crime policies.

* Develop your critical and analytical skills through discussion and written assignments.

The course website is accessible without a UWnetID and features all of the slides, links to readings, and assignments. Note many readings are pay-walled and require a UWnetID to access. [See this page for instructions for adding a UW Library proxy to your browser for off-campus access to articles.](https://www.lib.washington.edu/help/connect/tools)

### [Course Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1382874)

The course Canvas will be used to access some readings, post discussion questions, and submit assignments. Do not use Canvas messages for communication with the instructor--it will not be monitored for messages.

## Course Requirements

Grades will be assessed with the following breakdown:

| Item                   | Number | Percent of Grade |
|:----------------------:|:------:|:----------------:|
| Discussion Questions   | 16     |     10           |
| Midterm Exams          |  2     |     40           |
| Final Exam             |  1     |     30           |
| Essay                  |  1     |     20           |

A score of at least 95% will guarantee a 4.0 in the course. Every 2.5 percentage points below 95 
will correspond to a .1 difference in the final grade (e.g. 90/100 is a 3.8).
